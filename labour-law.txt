1. INTRODUCTION
Labour law also known as employment law is the body of laws, administrative rulings, and
precedents which address the legal rights of, and restrictions on, working people and their
organizations. As such, it mediates many aspects of the relationship between trade unions,
employers and employees. In other words, Labour law defines the rights and obligations as workers,
union members and employers in the workplace. Generally, labour law covers:
 Industrial relations – certification of unions, labour-management relations, collective
bargaining and unfair labour practices;
 Workplace health and safety;
 Employment standards, including general holidays, annual leave, working hours, unfair
dismissals, minimum wage, layoff procedures and severance pay.
There are two broad categories of labour law. First, collective labour law relates to the tripartite
relationship between employee, employer and union. Second, individual labour law concerns
employees' rights at work and through the contract for work.
The labour movement has been instrumental in the enacting of laws protecting labour rights in the
19th and 20th centuries. Labour rights have been integral to the social and economic development
since the industrial revolution.
1.1.History of Labour laws
Labour law arose due to the demands of workers for better conditions, the right to organize, and the
simultaneous demands of employers to restrict the powers of workers in many organizations and to
keep labour costs low. Employers' costs can increase due to workers organizing to win higher wages,
or by laws imposing costly requirements, such as health and safety or equal opportunities
conditions. Workers' organizations, such as trade unions, can also transcend purely industrial
disputes, and gain political power - which some employers may oppose. The state of labour law at
any one time is therefore both the product of, and a component of, struggles between different
interests in society.
International Labour Organisation (ILO) was one of the first organisations to deal with labour issues.
The ILO was established as an agency of the League of Nations following the Treaty of Versailles,
which ended World War I. Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour unions occupied the
attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I. In Great Britain, the Whitley
4
Commission, a subcommittee of the Reconstruction Commission, recommended in its July 1918 Final
Report that "industrial councils" be established throughout the world. The British Labour Party had
issued its own reconstruction programme in the document titled Labour and the New Social Order.
In February 1918, the third Inter-Allied Labour and Socialist Conference (representing delegates from
Great Britain, France, Belgium and Italy) issued its report, advocating an international labour rights
body, an end to secret diplomacy, and other goals. And in December 1918, the American Federation
of Labor (AFL) issued its own distinctively apolitical report, which called for the achievement of
numerous incremental improvements via the collective bargaining process.
As the war drew to a close, two competing visions for the post-war world emerged. The first was
offered by the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), which called for a meeting in Berne
in July 1919. The Berne meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various
proposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also proposed including
delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the
meeting, wanting the Central Powers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their
countries' role in the bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favored a meeting in Paris which would
only consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as a platform. Despite the American
boycott, the Berne meeting went ahead as scheduled. In its final report, the Berne Conference
demanded an end to wage labour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be
immediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of Nations should enact
and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade unions.
The British proposed establishing an international parliament to enact labour laws which each
member of the League would be required to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to
the parliament, one each from labour and management. An international labour office would collect
statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws. Philosophically opposed to the
concept of an international parliament and convinced that international standards would lower the
few protections achieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour body
be authorized only to make recommendations, and that enforcement be left up to the League of
Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the American proposal was adopted.
The Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That labour should not be
treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to a wage sufficient to live on; and that
women should receive equal pay for equal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech,
press, assembly, and association was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed
ban on the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16 was amended to
5
ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to require an eight-hour work day was
amended to require the eight-hour work day or the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for
countries where productivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile,
international delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted: One or more days
for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and regular and frequent inspection of factory
conditions.
The Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace Conference adopted it
without amendment on 11 April. The report became Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. (The Treaty
of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war
between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919.)
The first annual conference (referred to as the International Labour Conference, or ILC) began on
29th
 October 1919 in Washington DC and adopted the first six International Labour Conventions,
which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity protection, night work for
women, minimum age and night work for young persons in industry. The prominent French socialist
Albert Thomas became its first Director General. The ILO became a member of the United Nations
system after the demise of the League in 1946.
1.2.Purpose of labour legislation
Labour legislation that is adapted to the economic and social challenges of the modern world of
work fulfils three crucial roles:
 it establishes a legal system that facilitates productive individual and collective employment
relationships, and therefore a productive economy;
 by providing a framework within which employers, workers and their representatives can
interact with regard to work-related issues, it serves as an important vehicle for achieving
harmonious industrial relations based on workplace democracy;
 it provides a clear and constant reminder and guarantee of fundamental principles and
rights at work which have received broad social acceptance and establishes the processes
through which these principles and rights can be implemented and enforced.
But experience shows that labour legislation can only fulfills these functions effectively if it is
responsive to the conditions on the labour market and the needs of the parties involved. The most
efficient way of ensuring that these conditions and needs are taken fully into account is if those
concerned are closely involved in the formulation of the legislation through processes of social
6
dialogue. The involvement of stakeholders in this way is of great importance in developing a broad
basis of support for labour legislation and in facilitating its application within and beyond the formal
structured sectors of the economy.
1.3.Evolution of Labour law in India
The law relating to labour and employment is also known as Industrial law in India. The history of
labour legislation in India is interwoven with the history of British colonialism. The industrial/labour
legislations enacted by the British were primarily intended to protect the interests of the British
employers. Considerations of British political economy were naturally paramount in shaping some of
these early laws. Thus came the Factories Act. It is well known that Indian textile goods offered stiff
competition to British textiles in the export market and hence in order to make India labour costlier
the Factories Act was first introduced in 1883 because of the pressure brought on the British
parliament by the textile magnates of Manchester and Lancashire. Thus India received the first
stipulation of eight hours of work, the abolition of child labour, and the restriction of women in night
employment, and the introduction of overtime wages for work beyond eight hours. While the
impact of this measure was clearly welfarist the real motivation was undoubtedly protectionist.
The earliest Indian statute to regulate the relationship between employer and his workmen was the
Trade Dispute Act, 1929 (Act 7 of 1929). Provisions were made in this Act for restraining the rights of
strike and lock out but no machinery was provided to take care of disputes.
The original colonial legislation underwent substantial modifications in the post-colonial era because
independent India called for a clear partnership between labour and capital. The content of this
partnership was unanimously approved in a tripartite conference in December 1947 in which it was
agreed that labour would be given a fair wage and fair working conditions and in return capital
would receive the fullest co-operation of labour for uninterrupted production and higher
productivity as part of the strategy for national economic development and that all concerned would
observe a truce period of three years free from strikes and lockouts. Ultimately the Industrial
Disputes Act (the Act) brought into force on 01.04.1947 repealing the Trade Disputes Act 1929 has
since remained on statute book.
1.4.Constitutional provisions with regard to labour laws
The relevance of the dignity of human labour and the need for protecting and safeguarding the
interest of labour as human beings has been enshrined in Chapter-III (Articles 16, 19, 23 & 24) and
7
Chapter IV (Articles 39, 41, 42, 43, 43A & 54) of the Constitution of India keeping in line with
Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy.
Labour is a concurrent subject in the Constitution of India implying that both the Union and the state
governments are competent to legislate on labour matters and administer the same. The bulk of
important legislative acts have been enacted by the Parliament.
Constitutional Status
Union List Concurrent List
The legislations can be categorized as follows:
1) Labour laws enacted by the Central Government, where the Central Government has the
sole responsibility for enforcement.
2) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced both by Central and State
Governments.
3) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced by the State Governments.
4) Labour laws enacted and enforced by the various State Governments which apply to
respective States.
The Constitution of India provides detailed provisions for the rights of the citizens and also lays down
the Directive Principles of State Policy which set an aim to which the activities of the state are to be
guided. These Directive Principles provide:
8
a. for securing the health and strength of employees, men and women;
b. that the tender age of children are not abused;
c. that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age
or strength;
d. just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief are provided; and
e. that the Government shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure
the participation of employee in the management of undertakings, establishments or other
organisations engaged in any industry.
1.5 Labour Policy of India
Labour policy in India has been evolving in response to specific needs of the situation to suit
requirements of planned economic development and social justice and has two fold objectives,
namely maintaining industrial peace and promoting the welfare of labour.

2. LABOUR LAWS IN INDIA
The term ‘labour’ means productive work especially physical work done for wages. Labour law also
known as employment law is the body of laws, administrative rulings, and precedents which address
the legal rights of, and restrictions on, working people and their organizations. There are two broad
categories of labour law. First, collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between
employee, employer and union. Second, individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work
and through the contract for work.
The law relating to labour and employment in India is primarily known under the
broad category of "Industrial Law". The prevailing social and economic conditions have been largely
influential in shaping the Indian labour legislation, which regulate various aspects of work such as
the number of hours of work, wages, social security and facilities provided.
10
The labour laws of independent India derive their origin, inspiration and strength partly from the
views expressed by important nationalist leaders during the days of national freedom struggle,
partly from the debates of the Constituent Assembly and partly from the provisions of the
Constitution and the International Conventions and Recommendations. The relevance of the dignity
of human labour and the need for protecting and safeguarding the interest of labour as human
beings has been enshrined in Chapter-III (Articles 16, 19, 23 & 24) and Chapter IV (Articles 39, 41, 42,
43, 43A & 54) of the Constitution of India keeping in line with Fundamental Rights and Directive
Principles of State Policy. The Labour Laws were also influenced by important human rights and the
conventions and standards that have emerged from the United Nations. These include right to work
of one’s choice, right against discrimination, prohibition of child labour, just and humane conditions
of work, social security, protection of wages, redress of grievances, right to organize and form trade
unions, collective bargaining and participation in management. The labour laws have also been
significantly influenced by the deliberations of the various Sessions of the Indian Labour Conference
and the International Labour Conference. Labour legislations have also been shaped and influenced
by the recommendations of the various National Committees and Commissions such as First
National Commission on Labour (1969) under the Chairmanship of Justice Gajendragadkar, National
Commission on Rural Labour (1991), Second National Commission on Labour (2002) under the
Chairmanship of Shri Ravindra Varma etc. and judicial pronouncements on labour related matters
specifically pertaining to minimum wages, bonded labour, child labour, contract labour etc.
Under the Constitution of India, Labour is a subject in the concurrent list where both the Central and
State Governments are competent to enact legislations. As a result , a large number of labour laws
have been enacted catering to different aspects of labour namely, occupational health, safety,
employment, training of apprentices, fixation, review and revision of minimum wages, mode of
payment of wages, payment of compensation to workmen who suffer injuries as a result of
accidents or causing death or disablement, bonded labour, contract labour, women labour and child
labour, resolution and adjudication of industrial disputes, provision of social security such as
provident fund, employees’ state insurance, gratuity, provision for payment of bonus, regulating the
working conditions of certain specific categories of workmen such as plantation labour, beedi
workers etc.
The legislations can be categorized as follows:
11
1) Labour laws enacted by the Central Government, where the Central Government has the
sole responsibility for enforcement.
2) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced both by Central and State
Governments.
3) Labour laws enacted by Central Government and enforced by the State Governments.

The main purpose of the Act is to provide practical training to technically qualified persons in various
trades. The objective is promotion of new skilled manpower. The scheme is also extended to
engineers and diploma holders.
The Act applies to areas and industries as notified by Central government. [Section 1(4)].
Scheme of the Act
There are 38 Sections in total and 1 Schedule. This Schedule is about modifications in the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 with regard to its application to apprentices under the
Apprentices Act, 1961.
Obligation of Employer
 Every employer is under obligation to provide the apprentice with the training in his trade in
accordance with the provisions of this Act and the rules made there under.
 If the employer is not himself qualified in the trade, he has to ensure that a person who
possesses the prescribed qualification is placed in charge of the training of the apprentice.
 Every employer has to provide adequate instructional staff, possessing such qualifications as
may be prescribed for imparting practical and theoretical training and facilities for trade test
of apprentices; and
 Every employer is under obligation to take apprentices in prescribed ratio of the skilled
workers in his employment in different trades. [Section 11].
 In every trade, there will be reserved places for scheduled castes and schedules tribes.
[Section 3A]. Ratio of trade apprentices to workers shall be determined by Central
Government.
 Employer can engage more number of apprentices than prescribed minimum. [Section 8(1)].
 The employer has to make arrangements for practical training of apprentice [Section 9(1)].
 Employer will pay stipends to apprentices at prescribed rates. If the employees are less than
250, 50% of cost is shared by Government. If employer is employing more than 250
workers, he has to bear full cost of training.
30
Obligations of Apprentices
Every trade apprentice undergoing apprenticeship training shall have the following obligations,
namely:
 To learn his trade conscientiously and diligently and endeavour to qualify himself as a skilled
craftsman before the expiry of the period of training;
 To attend practical and instructional classes regularly;
 To carry out all lawful orders of his employer and superiors in the establishments; and
 To carry out his obligations under the contract of apprenticeship.
In case of graduate or technician apprentice or technician (vocational) apprentice, apart from the
afore stated obligations, the Act imposes further obligation to learn his subject in Engineering or
Technology or Vocational Course. (Section 12)
Who can be an Apprentice - Apprentice should be of minimum age of 14 years and he should satisfy
the standard of education and physical fitness as prescribed. [Section 3].
Reservation of training places for scheduled castes
Section 3A provides that in every designated trade, training places shall be reserved by the employer
for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (as defined in clauses (24) and (25) of Article 366 of
the Constitution) and where there is more than one designated trade in an establishment, such
training places shall be reserved on the basis on the total number of apprentices in all the
designated trades in such establishment. The reservation shall be such as may be prescribed having
regard to the population of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State concerned.
Duration of Training - Duration of training period and ratio of apprentices to skilled workers for
different trades has been prescribed in Apprenticeship Rules, 1991. Duration of Apprenticeship may
be from 6 months to 4 years depending on the trade, as prescribed in Rules. Period of training is
determined by National Council for training in Vocational Trades (established by Government of
India)-(Section 6).
Contract with Apprentice – Apprentice appointed has to execute a contract of apprenticeship with
employer. The contract has to be registered with Apprenticeship Adviser. If apprentice is minor,
agreement should be signed by his guardian. [Section 4(1)] Apprentice is entitled to casual leave of
12 days, medical leave of 15 days and extraordinary leave of 10 days in a year.
31
Date of commencement of apprenticeship training
The apprenticeship training shall be deemed to have commenced on the date on which the contract
of apprenticeship has been entered into.
Registration
 The employer shall send the contract to the Apprenticeship adviser for registration within
three months of the date on which it was signed (Rule 6).
 The contract shall be registered by the Apprenticeship Adviser on being satisfied that the
person described as an apprentice in the said contract is qualified under this Act.
 Registration of contract of apprenticeship under Section 4(4) is not a necessary ingredient of
definition of apprentice. (Bhaskaran v. KSEB (1986) 1 LLN 869).
Terms and conditions of contract
The contract may contain such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the parties to the
contract. In case, the Central Government after consulting the Central Apprenticeship Council makes
any rule varying the terms and conditions of apprenticeship training of any category of apprentices
undergoing such training then the terms and conditions of every contract relating to that category of
apprentices and subsisting immediately before the making of such rule shall be deemed to have
been modified accordingly.
Novation of contract of apprenticeship:
Where an employer is for any reason unable to fulfill his obligations under the contract and with
approval of the Apprenticeship Adviser it is agreed between the employer, the apprentice or his
guardian and any other employer that the apprentice shall be engaged as an apprentice under the
other employer for the unexpired portion of the period of apprenticeship training, the agreement,
on registration with the Apprenticeship Adviser shall be deemed to be the contract of apprenticeship
between the apprentice or his guardian and other employer. Such contract on and from the date of
such registration shall be terminated with the first employer and no obligation under that contract
shall be enforceable (Section 5).
Payment to apprentices
32
This is a contractual as well as statutory obligation imposed under Section 13 of the Act that an
employer pays to every apprentice during the period of training such stipend at a rate not less than
the prescribed minimum rate and this rate will be specified in the contract. An employer shall pay
such stipend at such intervals and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed. However, an
apprentice shall not be paid on the basis of piece-work nor he shall take part in any output bonus or
other incentive scheme.
Termination of contract
The contract of apprenticeship training shall terminate on the expiry of the period of apprenticeship
training. Either party can make application for termination of contract to the Apprenticeship Adviser
and thereafter send a copy of the same to the other party, who on being satisfied that the parties
have failed to carry out the terms and conditions of the contract and it is desirable in the interests of
the parties or any of them to terminate the contract, shall register the same. However, the employer
shall pay the prescribed amount of compensation to the apprentice where the contract is
terminated for failure on the part of the employer to honour the contract. Where the contract is
terminated for failure on the part of the apprentice, he or his guardian shall refund the cost of the
training to the employer. (Section 7)
Legal Position of Apprentices - An apprentice is not a workman during apprentice training. [Section
18] Provisions of labour law like Bonus, PF, ESI.
Act, gratuity, Industrial Disputes Act etc. are not applicable to him. However, provisions of Factories
Act regarding health, safety and welfare will apply to him. Apprentice is also entitled to get
compensation from employer for employment injury. [Section 16].
An employer is under no obligation to employ the apprentice after completion of apprenticeship.
[Section 22(1)]. However, in UP State Road Transport Corpn v. UP Parivahan Nigam Shishukh
Berozgar Sangh AIR 1995 SC 1114 = (1995) 2 SCC 1 , it was held that other things being equal, a
trained apprentice should be given preference over direct recruits. It was also held that he need not
be sponsored by the employment exchange. Age bar may also be relaxed, to the extent of training
period. The concerned institute should maintain a list of persons already trained and in between
trained apprentices, preference should be given to those who are senior. – same view in UP Rajya
Vidyut Parishad v. State of UP 2000 LLR 869 (SC).
33

under the Act.

Section 20 of the Act provides that if out of the terms and conditions of the contract any dispute
arises, it will be referred to Apprenticeship Adviser for decision. An appeal can be preferred by the
aggrieved party within 30 days of the communication of the Adviser’s decision to the Apprenticeship
Council and such appeal shall be heard and determined by the Committee of that Council appointed
for the purpose, and such decision of the Committee shall be final.

4b. Employee State Insurance Act, 1948
Introduction
The Employee State Insurance Act, [ESIC] 1948, is a piece of social welfare legislation enacted
primarily with the object of providing certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity
and employment injury and also to make provision for certain others matters incidental thereto. The
Act in fact tries to attain the goal of socio-economic justice enshrined in the Directive principles of
state policy under part 4 of our constitution, in particular articles 41, 42 and 43 which enjoin the
state to make effective provision for securing, the right to work, to education and public assistance
in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement. The act strives to materialize these
avowed objects through only to a limited extent. This act becomes a wider spectrum than factory
act. In the sense that while the factory act concerns with the health, safety, welfare, leave etc of the
workers employed in the factory premises only. But the benefits of this act extend to employees
whether working inside the factory or establishment or elsewhere or they are directly employed by
the principal employee or through an intermediate agency, if the employment is incidental or in
connection with the factory or establishment.

retail or wholesale or where services are rendered to customers, and includes an office, a
store-room, godown, warehouse or workhouse or work place, whether in the same premises
or otherwise, used in or in connection with such trade or business but does not include a
factory or a commercial establishment. “Establishment” means a shop, a commercial
establishment, residential hotel, restaurant, eating-house, theatre or other places of public
amusement or entertainment to which this Act applies and includes such other
establishment as Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare to be an
establishment for the purpose of this Act. According to the Delhi Shops and Establishment
Act, 1954, “Commercial Establishment” means any premises wherein any trade, business or
profession or any work in connection with, or incidental or ancillary thereto is carried on and
includes a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and charitable or
other trust, whether registered or not, which carries on any business, trade or profession or
work in connection with, or incidental or ancillary thereto, journalistic and printing
establishments, contractors and auditors establishments, quarries and mines not governed
by the Mines Act, 1952, educational or other institutions run for private gain, and premises
in which business of banking, insurance, stocks and shares, brokerage or produce exchange
is carried on, but does not include a shop or a factory registered under the Factories Act,
1948, or theatres, cinemas, restaurants, eating houses, residential hotels, clubs or other
places of public amusements or entertainment. Form 01 – Employers’ Registration Form also
requires a copy of the registration certificate or licence obtained under the Shops and
Establishment Act to be attached along with this form. From this it is quite evident that ESI
Act will be applicable to shops and establishments. Again the definition of shops and
establishment will vary from state to state depending on the shops and establishment act of
that particular state.
 The act does not apply to any member of Indian Naval, Military or Air Forces.
 All employees including casual, temporary or contract employees drawing wages less than
Rs 10,000 per month are covered. The ceiling limit has been raised from Rs.7500 to Rs.10000
with effect from 01.10.06.
 Apprentices covered under the Apprenticeship Act are not covered under this Act. According
to Apprenticeship Act 1961, “apprentice” means a person who is undergoing apprenticeship
training in pursuance of a contract of apprenticeship.
o The apprentices under any scheme as the name suggests come to learn the tricks of
the trade and may not count much so far as the output of the factory is concerned,
with that end in view, the apprentices are exempted from the operation of laws
40
relating to labour unless the State Government thought otherwise.-- Regional
Director ESIC v. M/s Arudyog 1987 (1) LLJ 292.
 A factory or establishment, to which this Act applies, shall continue to be governed by its
provisions even if the number of workers employed falls below the specified limit or the
manufacturing process therein ceases to be carried on with the aid of power subsequently.
 Where a workman is covered under the ESI scheme,
o Compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act cannot be claimed in
respect of employment injury.
o No benefits can be claimed under the Maternity Benefits Act.
Important Case laws
1. Where by some club not only sporting facilities but a kitchen is also maintained, wherein a
big number of members come, it is not necessary that they are participating only in sports
activities, they are also entertaining themselves and their guests by partaking beverages and
tea served by the club. Activity in the kitchen has a direct connection with the activities
carried on in the rest of the club premises. It is necessary that the club be registered under
ESI Act as regards all the employees engaged by the club irrespective of the fact in which
department they are working. Cricket Club of India satisfies the definition of the term
`factory' under s. 2(12) of the Act hence covered by it.-- Cricket Club of India v. ESI
Corporation 1994 (69) FLR 19.
2. Where in an establishment activities like that of clearing and forwarding is going on, it would
fall within the expression "shop" even though clearing of documents is done in customs
house meant for export and import of goods. Person involved in such business is catering to
the needs of exporters and importers and others wanting to carry the goods further. -- AIR
1993 SC 252 .
3. Anyone having product may approach advertising agency. The advertising agency will
prepare an advertising campaign for him utilising the services of the experts it employs in
this behalf. It sells the campaign to the client and receives the price thereof. Indubitably, the
price will depend upon the nature of the campaign but that does not make any great
difference. Essentially, the advertising agency sells its expert services to a client to enable
the client to launch an effective campaign of his products without staining the language, the
premises of an advertising agency can be said to be a "shop"--ESI Corporation v. R.K. Swamy
1993 (67) FLR 1145 : 1993 (2) CLR 1068.
4. Where a laid-off employee after signing the lay-off register was coming out of the factory
premises and when crossing the road was hit by a scooter, injuries sustained by him were
41
taken as covered during the course of employment on the basis of theory of notional
extension.-- Satya Sharma v. ESI Corporation 1991 (63) FLR 339 .
5. If the work by the employee is conducted under the immediate gaze or overseeing of the
principal employer or his agent, subject to other conditions as envisaged being fulfilled he
would be an employee for the purpose of s. 2(9).-- CES Corporation Ltd. v. Subash Chandra
Bose 1992 (1) LLJ 475.
6. A work that is conducive to the work of the factory or establishment or that is necessary for
the augmentation of the work of the factory or establishment will be incidental or
preliminary to or connected with the work of the factory or establishment. The casual
employees shall also be brought within it and are entitled to the benefits which the Act
grants. The casual labour employed to construct additional buildings for expansion of the
factory are the employees under the Act.-- Regional Director, ESIC v. South India Flour Mills
Ltd. 1986 (53) FLR 178.
7. Employees engaged for repairs, site clearing, construction of buildings, etc. of the principal
employer are employees within the meaning of s. 2(9) of the Act. --Kirloskar Pneumatic Co.
Ltd. v. ESI Corporation 1987 (70) FJR 199.
8. The expression "employed for wages or in connection with the work of a factory or
establishment" is of very wide amplitude and its generality is not in any way prejudiced by
the expression and includes any person employed for wages or any work connected with the
administration of the factory or establishment or in connection with sale or distribution of
the products of the factory or establishments. The word "includes" in the statutory
definition of a term is generally used to enlarge the meaning of the preceding words and it is
by way of extension and not with restriction. In order to determine whether the employees
of the company working at its branch sales offices and carrying on acts of sale and
distribution of goods manufactured by the company as well as the goods produced by the
foreign company are "employees" what is pertinent is not whether they are "principally" and
primarily engaged in sale and distribution of the products of the company but whether the
business of sale and distribution either "principally" or "marginally" of the products of the
foreign company is being done on behalf of the company. If the main business of the
company itself at the branch sales offices, is to sell and distribute products of foreign
company and the employees working have been employed by the company basically in
connection with this work, it would be difficult to hold that the employees at branch sales
offices are not "employees" within the meaning of the term defined in s. 2(9) of the Act
notwithstanding the fact that the sale and distribution of the products of the company at
42
such offices are only marginal.-- Director General, ESI Corporation v. Scientific Instrument Co.
Ltd. 1995 Lab. IC 651 .
9. Where the work of fixing the marble is extended to a contractor by a marble manufacturing
company, duty of the contractor is only to complete the work while marble, cement etc., is
supplied by the manufacturing company, workers employed by the contractor would be the
employees of the factory as under s. 2(9) of the Act.-- 1992 (2) CLR 881.
10. There is no such difference as that of casual or temporary or permanent employee for the
expression "employee" as defined under s. 2(9) of the Act. It is so wide as to include even a
casual employee who is employed just for a day for wages. The test being whether the
person is employed for wages on any work which is connected with the work of a factory or
establishment which bears the application of the Act except those exempted by the
definition.-- ESI Corporation v. Suvarna Saw Mills 1980 (57) FJR 154.
11. Where a department of publication and press run by the university concerned is engaged in
the printing of text books, journals, registers, forms, etc., that would amount to
manufacturing process.-- Osmania University v. ESI Corporation 1986 (1) LLN 72 .
12. Where there was no manufacturing of articles nor the hotel was manufacturing any article
with the aid of power except maintaining one refrigerator to preserve milk and curd, and as
there was no using of power in the kitchen for making the eatables and the refrigerator had
been kept only for preservation of milk and curd, there was no manufacturing process.-- Ritz
Hotel v. ESI Corpn. 1995 (1) Mah. LJ 63.
13. Wages paid for the holidays are wages as defined.-- R.D., ESI Corporation v. Raj Keshaw Co.
1991 Lab. IC 1991 Lab. IC 1989.
14. Overtime wages could not be treated as "wages" for the purpose of contribution under the
Act.-- Hind Art Press v. ESI Corporation 1990 (1) LLJ 195.
15. The ESI Corporation is conferred with the power to recover arrears of contributions from the
employer along with damages/interest on the contribution that remained due.
Correspondingly it is under an obligation to pay with interest the arrears of benefits to the
insured employees or his dependents.-- ESI Corporation v. Bhag Singh 1989 (2) LLJ 126.
16. Section 53 of the ESI Act (Bar against receiving or recovery of compensation or damages
under any other law) does not bar the remedy under s. 110A of the Motor Vehicles Act,
1939.-- Deputy General Manager KSRTC v. Gopal Mudaliar 1983 (46) FLR 194.
Areas Covered
43
The ESI Scheme is being implemented area-wise by stages. The Scheme is being implemented in
almost all union territories and states except Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh
and Mizoram.
Administration of the Act
The provisions of the Act are administered by the Employees State Insurance Corporation. It
comprises members representing employees, employers, the central and state government, besides,
representatives of parliament and medical profession. A standing committee constituted from
amongst the members of the corporation, acts as an executive body. The medical benefit council,
constituted by the central government, is another statutory body that advises the corporation on
matters regarding administration of medical benefit, the certification for purposes of the grant of
benefits and other connected matters.
Registration
The employer should get his factory or establishment registered with the ESI Corporation within 15
days after the Act becomes applicable to it and also obtain the employer’s code number. Application
should be made in Form 01 and after having being satisfied with the application form, the regional
office will allot a code number to the employer, which must be quoted in all documents and
correspondence.
Identity Card
An employee is required to file a declaration form upon employment in factory or establishment to
show that he is covered under the Act.
On registration every insured person is provided with a ‘temporary identification certificate’ which is
valid ordinarily for a period of three months but may be extended, if necessary, for a further period
of 3 months. Within this period, the insured person is given a permanent ‘family photo identity card’
in exchange for the certificate. The identity card serves as a means of identification and has to be
produced at the time of claiming medical care at the dispensary / clinic and cash benefit at the local
office of the corporation. In the event of change of employment, it should be produced before the
new employer as evidence of registration under the scheme to prevent any duplicate registration.
The identity card bears the signature/thumb impression of the insured person. Since medical benefit
is also available to the families of Insured persons, the particulars of family members entitled to
medical benefit are also given in the identity card affixed with a postcard size family photo. If the
identity card is lost, a duplicate card is issued on payment as prescribed.
44
Employers’ / Employees’ Contribution
Like most of the social security schemes, the world over, ESI scheme is a self-financing health
insurance scheme. Contributions are raised from covered employees and their employers as a fixed
percentage of wages. Presently covered employees contribute 1.75% of the wages, whereas as the
employers contribute 4.75% of the wages, payable to the insured persons. Employees earning less
than and up to Rs. 50 per day are exempted from payment of contribution.
The contribution is deposited by the employer in cash or by cheque at the designated branches of
some nationalized banks. The responsibility for payment of all contributions is that of the employer
with a right to deduct the employees share of contribution from employees’ wages relating to the
period in respect of which the contribution is payable.
There are two contribution periods each of six months duration and two corresponding benefit
periods. Cash benefits under the scheme are generally linked with contribution paid.
Contribution period - 1st April to 30th September, its corresponding Cash Benefit period is 1st
January to 30th June of the following year.
Contribution period - 1st October to 31st March, its corresponding Cash Benefit period is 1st July to
31st December of the following year.

4f. INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES ACT, 1947
Introduction
Prior to the year 1947, industrial disputes were being settled under the provisions of the Trade
Disputes Act, 1929. Experience of the working of the 1929 Act revealed various defects, which
needed to be overcome by a fresh legislation. Accordingly the Industrial Disputes Bill was introduced
in the Legislature. The Bill was referred to the select committee. On the recommendations of the
Select Committee amendments were made in the original Bill.
The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 came into existence in April 1947. It was enacted to make

Chapter – IV lays down the procedure, power and duties of the authorities constituted under the
Act. Chapter – V contains provisions to prohibit strikes and lockouts, declaration of strikes and
lockouts as illegal, and provisions relating to lay-off and retrenchment and closure. Chapter-VI
contains provisions of various penalties under the Act. Chapter–VII contains miscellaneous
provisions.
Definition of Industrial Disputes
An industrial dispute may be defined as a conflict or difference of opinion between management

management and the workmen, try to pressurize each other. The management may resort to
lockouts while the workers may resort to strikes, picketing or gheraos.
As per Section 2(k) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, an industrial dispute is defined as any dispute or
difference between employees and employers, or between employers and workmen, or between
75
workmen and which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the terms of

off or retrenchment.
(b) The procedure for prior permission of appropriate Government for laying off or
retrenching the workers or closing down industrial establishments
(c) Unfair labour practices on part of an employer or a trade union or workers.
Applicability
The Industrial Disputes Act extends to whole of India and applies to every industrial establishment
carrying on any business, trade, manufacture or distribution of goods and services irrespective of the

where 20 or more workmen are employed on any day during an accounting year.
Eligibility for Bonus
Every employee receiving salary or wages upto Rs. 10,000 p.m. and engaged in any kind of work
whether skilled, unskilled, managerial, supervisory etc. is entitled to bonus for every accounting year
if he has worked for at least 30 working days in that year.
Where an employee has not worked for all the working days in an accounting year, the minimum
bonus of one hundred rupees or, as the case may be, of sixty rupees, if such bonus is higher than
8.33 per cent, of his salary or wage for the days he has worked in that accounting year, shall be
proportionately reduced.
However employees of L.I.C., Universities and Educational institutions, Hospitals, Chamber of
Commerce, R.B.I., IFCI, U.T.I., IDBI, NABARD, SIDBI, Social Welfare institutions are not entitled to
bonus under this Act.
Calculation for Working Days in An Accounting Year

the days on which--
(a) he has been laid off under an agreement or as permitted by standing orders under the
Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (20 of 1946), or under the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947), or under any other law applicable to the establishment;
84

bonus, if he is dismissed from service for fraud or riotous or violent behaviour while in the premises
of the establishment or theft, misappropriation or sabotage of any property of the establishment.
Minimum and Maximum Bonus Payable
Minimum Bonus
 The minimum bonus which an employer is required to pay even if he suffers losses during
the accounting year or there is no allocable surplus is 8.33 % of the salary or wages during
the accounting year, or
 Rs. 100 in case of employees above 15 years and Rs 60 in case of employees below 15 years,
at the beginning of the accounting year, whichever is higher
Maximum Bonus
If in an accounting year, the allocable surplus, calculated after taking into account the amount ‘set
on’ or the amount ‘set of’ exceeds the minimum bonus, the employer should pay bonus in
proportion to the salary or wages earned by the employee in that accounting year subject to a
maximum of 20% of such salary or wages.
Time Limit for Payment
The bonus should be paid in cash within 8 months from the close of the accounting year or within
one month from the date of enforcement of the award or coming into operation of a settlement
following an industrial dispute regarding payment of bonus.
However if there is sufficient cause extension may be applied for.
85
Calculation of Bonus
The method for calculation of annual bonus is as follow:
1. Calculate the gross profit in the manner specified ina. First Schedule, in case of a banking company, or
b. Second Schedule, in any other case.
2. Calculate the Available Surplus.
Available Surplus = A+B, where A = Gross Profit – Depreciation admissible u/s 32 of the
Income tax Act - Development allowance - Direct taxes payable for the accounting year
(calculated as per Sec.7) – Sums specified in the Third Schedule.
B = Direct Taxes (calculated as per Sec. 7) in respect of gross profits for the immediately
preceding accounting year – Direct Taxes in respect of such gross profits as reduced by the
amount of bonus, for the immediately preceding accounting year.
3. Calculate Allocable Surplus
Allocable Surplus = 60% of Available Surplus, 67% in case of foreign companies.
4. Make adjustment for ‘Set-on’ and ‘Set-off’. For calculating the amount of bonus in respect of
an accounting year, allocable surplus is computed after considering the amount of set on
and set off from the previous years, as illustrated in Fourth Schedule.
5. The allocable surplus so computed is distributed amongst the employees in proportion to
salary or wages received by them during the relevant accounting year.
In case of an employee receiving salary or wages above Rs. 3,500 the bonus payable is to be
calculated as if the salary or wages were Rs. 3,500 p.m. only.

90
Rate of gratuity
For every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months, the employer shall pay

employment, and, for this purpose, the wages paid for any overtime work shall not be taken into
account.
In the case of an employee who is employed in a seasonal establishment and who is not so
employed throughout the year, the employer shall pay the gratuity at the rate of seven days wages
for each season.
In the case of a monthly rated employee, the fifteen days wages shall be calculated by dividing the

The appropriate Government may, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed, exempt every
employer who had already established an approved gratuity fund in respect of his employees and
who desires to continue such arrangement and every employer employing five hundred or more
persons who establishes an approved gratuity fund in the manner prescribed.
Where an employer fails to make any payment by way of premium to the insurance or by way of
'contribution to all approved gratuity fund, he shall be liable to pay the amount of gratuity due
91
under this Act (including interest, if any, for delayed payments) forthwith to the controlling
authority.
Whoever contravenes the provision above shall be punishable with fine which may extend to Rs
10,000/- and in the case of a continuing offence with a further fine which may extend to Rs 1000/-

Definition of Disablement
Disablement is the loss of the earning capacity resulting from injury caused to a workman by an
accident.
 Disablements can be classified as (a) Total, and (b) Partial. It can further be classified into (i)
Permanent, and (ii) Temporary, Disablement, whether permanent or temporary is said to be
total when it incapacitates a worker for all work he was capable of doing at the time of the
accident resulting in such disablement.
 Total disablement is considered to be permanent if a workman, as a result of an accident,
suffers from the injury specified in Part I of Schedule I or suffers from such combination of
injuries specified in Part II of Schedule I as would be the loss of earning capacity when
totalled to one hundred per cent or more. Disablement is said to be permanent partial when
it reduces for all times, the earning capacity of a workman in every employment, which he
was capable of undertaking at the time of the accident. Every injury specified in Part II of
Schedule I is deemed to result in permanent partial disablement.
94
 Temporary disablement reduces the earning capacity of a workman in the employment in
which he was engaged at the time of the accident.
Accident Arising Out Of And In The Course Of Employment
An accident arising out of employment implies a casual connection between the injury and the
accident and the work done in the course of employment. Employment should be the distinctive and
the proximate cause of the injury. The three tests for determining whether an accident arose out of
employment are:
1. At the time of injury workman must have been engaged in the business of the employer and
must not be doing something for his personal benefit;
2. That accident occurred at the place where he as performing his duties; and
3. Injury must have resulted from some risk incidental to the duties of the service, or inherent
in the nature condition of employment.
Amount of compensation
The amount of compensation payable will be as follows, namely :-
(a) where death results an amount equal to fifty per cent of the monthly wages of the deceased
workman multiplied by the relevant factor; or an amount of fifty thousand rupees, whichever is
more;
(b) where permanent total an amount equal to disablement results from sixty the injury per cent of
the monthly wages of the injured workman multiplied by the relevant factor, or an amount of sixty
thousand rupees, whichever is more; For the purposes of clause (a) and clause (b), "relevant factor",
in relation to a workman means the factor specified in the second column of Schedule IV against the
entry in the first column of that Schedule specifying the number of years which are the same as the
completed years of the age of the workman on his last birthday immediately preceding the date on
which the compensation fell due. Where the monthly wages of a workman exceed two thousand
rupees, his monthly wages for the purposes of clause (a) and clause (b) shall be deemed to be two
thousand rupees only;
(c) where permanent partial disablement results from the injury (i) in the case of an injury specified
in Part II of Schedule I, such percentage of the compensation which would have been payable in the
95
case of permanent total disablement as is specified therein as being the percentage of the loss of

with his dependant at the time of his death to the person who actually incurred such expenditure
General principles of the Act
 There must be a casual connection between the injury and the accident and the work done
in the course of employment;
 The onus is upon the applicant to show that it was the work and the resulting strain which
contributed to or aggravated the injury;
 It is not necessary that the workman must be actually working at the time of his death or
that death must occur while he was working or had just ceased to work; and
 Where the evidence is balanced, if the evidence shows a greater probability which satisfies a
reasonable man that the work contributed to the causing of the personal injury it would be
enough for the workman to succeed. But where the accident involved a risk common to all
humanity and did not involve any peculiar or exceptional danger resulting from the nature of
the employment or where the accident was the result of an added peril to which the
workman by his own conduct exposed himself, which peril was not involved in the normal
performance of the duties of his employment, then the employer will not be liable.
Employer’s fault is immaterial
The compensation is payable even when there was no fault of employer. In New India Assurance Co.
Ltd. v. Pennamna Kuriern - (1995) 84 Comp. Cas. 251 (Ker HC DB), claim of workmen for
compensation under Motor Vehicle Act was rejected due to negligence of employee, but
compensation was awarded under Workmen’s Compensation Act on the principle of ‘no fault’.
97
Compensation payable even if workman was careless
Compensation is payable even if it is found that the employee did not take proper precautions. An
employee is not entitled to get compensation only if (a) he was drunk or had taken drugs (b) he
wilfully disobeyed orders in respect of safety (c) he wilfully removed safety guards of machines.
However, compensation cannot be denied on the ground that workman was negligent or careless. –
Mar Themotheous v. Santosh Raj 2001 LLR 164 (Ker HC DB).
Number of Workmen Employed Is Not Criteria
In definition of ‘workman’ in schedule II, in most of the cases, number of workmen employed is not
the criteria. In most of cases, employer will be liable even if just one workman is employed. The Act
applies to a workshop even if it employs less than 20 workmen and is not a ‘factory’ under Factories
Act. – Sunil Industries v. Ram Chander 2000 AIR SCW 4109 = 2001 LLR 64 = 2000(7) SCALE 415.
Payment of compensation only through Commissioner - A Commissioner for Workmen’s
Compensation is appointed by Government. The compensation must be paid only through the
Commissioner in case of death or total disablement. Any lump sum payment to workman under the
Act must be made only through Commissioner. Direct payment to workman or his dependents is not
recognized at all as compensation.

4m. MINIMUM WAGES ACT, 1948
The concept of Minimum Wages was first evolved by ILO in 1928 with reference to remuneration of
workers in those industries where the, level of wages was substantially low and the labour was
vulnerable to exploitation, being not well organised and having less effective bargaining power. The
need for a legislation for fixation of minimum wages in India received boost after World War – II
when a draft bill was considered by the Indian Labour Conference in 1945. On the recommendation
of the 8th Standing Labour Committee, the Minimum Wages Bill was introduced in the Central
Legislative assembly on 11.4.1946 to provide for fixation of minimum wages in certain employments.
The Minimum Wages Bill was passed by the Indian Dominion Legislature and came into force on
15th March, 1948. Under the Act both State and Central Government are “Appropriate
Governments” for fixation/revision of minimum rates of wages for employments covered by the
Schedule to the Act. The minimum rates of wages also include Special Allowance (Variable Dearness
Allowance) linked to Consumer Price Index Number which are revised twice a year effective from
April and October. The rates of wages once fixed are revised at an interval not exceeding of five
years.
The National Minimum Wage has been considered at various for a in the past. However, State/UT
Governments are not unanimous on the need of a National Minimum Wage as socioeconomic
conditions vary from state to state, region to region and also from industry to industry due to
different geographical, topographical and agro-climatic factors. The Six Regional Minimum Wages
Advisory Committees set up in 1987 to reduce regional disparities among States have been
broadened and renamed as Regional Labour Ministers’ Conferences.
Employer’s Checklist for Minimum Wages
The employer must pay every employee wages as fixed by the Government.
(a) Wages must be paid in cash.
(b) For the fixation of minimum wages, the employment must have been in Schedule originally or
added to the Schedule by a notification under Section 27 of the Act.
(c) The employer can take actual work on any day up to 9 hours in a 12 hours shift, but he must pay
double the rate for any hour or part of an hour of actual work in excess of 9 hours or for more than
48 hours in any week.
115
(d) Once a minimum wage is fixed according to the provisions of the Act, the employer must pay to
every employee engaged in a Scheduled employment, minimum wages notification for that class of
employees.
(e) The employer should fix wage-period for the payment of wages at intervals not exceeding one
month or such other larger period as may be prescribed.
(f) The employer should pay wages on a working day within seven days of the end of wage period or
within 10 days if 1000 or more persons are employed in an establishment.
(g) The employer should pay the wages to a person discharged not later than the second working
day after his discharge.
(h) Every employer should maintain a register of wages at workplace specifying the following
particulars for each wage period in respect of each employed person:
 i. Minimum rate of wages payable;
 ii. The number of days in which overtime was worked;
 iii. The gross wages;
 iv. The wages actually paid and the date of payment.

(i) Every employer should get the signature or the thumb impression of every person employed on
the wage book and the wage slips.
(j) The employer should exhibit at main entrance to the establishment and its offices, a notice in
respect of the following in English and local language:
 i. Minimum rates of wages;
 ii. Abstracts of the Acts and rules made there under;
 iii. Name and address of the Labour Inspector/ Asst. Commissioner of Labour etc.
The minimum wages covers all workers in the sectors agricultural, industrial and small-scale sectors.
116
This means:
 farm labourers
 landless labourers
 factory workers
 people working in cottage industries
 Construction workers etc.
The issue of fixation of minimum wages is of primary importance in a country like India where 300
million people are employed in the informal sector with no collective bargaining power. This is 93
percent of the workers. The enactment of the Minimum Wages Act in 1948 is a landmark in the
labour history of India. The Act provides for fixation of minimum wages for notified scheduled
employment.
As per Government of India, for all the States, the minimum wages have been fixed at about Rs 40 to
60 per day per person, average about Rs 50 per day for 25 days per month.
There are 45 scheduled employments in the Central sphere and 1232 in the state sphere for which
minimum wages have been fixed. To protect the wages against inflation they were linked to rise in
the Consumer Price Index.
The variable dearness allowance (VDA) came into being in 1991 and the allowance is revised twice a
year.
At present 22 states /Union Territories have these provisions. The states and Union Territories were
further directed to ensure that minimum wages are not below Rs 45 per day for any scheduled
employment.
Fixation of Minimum Wage Rate in India:
Minimum rate of the wages fixed or revised consists of the following:
 A basic rate of wages and a special allowance, viz., cost of living allowance ;
 A basic rate of wages with or without cost of living allowance and cash value of concessions
for supplies of essential commodities ;
 An all inclusive rate, i.e. basic rate, cost of living allowance and cash value of concessions.
117
The Government may fix the minimum rates of wages either by the hour, by the day, by the month
or by such wage period as may be prescribed.
The minimum wage rate may be fixed at
a) Time rate,
b) Piece rate,
c) Guaranteed time rate and
d) Overtime rate.
The Act provides that different minimum wage rate may be fixed for
a) Different scheduled employments,
b) Different works in the same employment,
c) Adult, adolescent and children,
d) Different locations or
e) Male and Female.
Also, such minimum wage may be fixed by
a) An hour,
b) Day,
c) Month, or
d) Any other period as may be prescribed by the notified authority.
Norms for fixing minimum wage:
 Three consumption units per earner,
 Minimum food requirement of 2700 calories per average Indian adult,
 Cloth requirement of 72 yards per annum per family,
118
 Rent corresponding to the minimum area provided under the government's Industrial
Housing Scheme and
 Fuel, lighting and other miscellaneous items of expenditure to constitute 20 per cent of the
total minimum wage
 Fuel, lighting and other miscellaneous items of expenditure to constitute 20% of the total
Minimum Wages,
 Children education, medical requirement, minimum recreation including
festivals/ceremonies and provision for old age, marriage etc. should further constitute 25%
of the total minimum wage.
Cost of Living Allowance:
The minimum basic wages fixed are linked to consumer price index as a counter measure against
inflation. The cost of living is set twice in a year. The Commissioner of Labour notifies the rate 1st of
April and 1st of October. The rates are fixed on the basis of the average rise in the State industrial
workers consumer price index numbers for half year ending December and June respectively.
Variable Dearness Allowance:
Dearness Allowance is payable to monthly, daily and piece rate earners. Every six months the
respective State Governments issues the Cost of Living Index number for each and every scheduled
employment.

4n. LAWS RELATED TO CHILD LABOUR
Background
The problem of child labour continues to pose a challenge before the nation. Government has been
taking various pro-active measures to tackle this problem. Way back in 1979, Government formed
the first committee called Gurupadswamy Committee to study the issue of child labour and to
suggest measures to tackle it. The Committee made some far-reaching recommendations. It
observed that as long as poverty continued, it would be difficult to totally eliminate child labour and
119
hence, any attempt to abolish it through legal recourse would not be a practical proposition. The
Committee felt that in the circumstances, the only alternative left was to ban child labour in
hazardous areas and to regulate and ameliorate the conditions of work in other areas. It
recommended that a multiple policy approach was required in dealing with the problems of working
children.
Based on the recommendations of Gurupadaswamy Committee, the Child Labour (Prohibition &
Regulation) Act was enacted in 1986. The Act prohibits employment of children in certain specified
hazardous occupations and processes and regulates the working conditions in others. The list of
hazardous occupations and processes is progressively being expanded on the recommendation of
Child Labour Technical Advisory Committee constituted under the Act.
 In consonance with the above approach, a National Policy on Child Labour was formulated in
1987. The Policy seeks to adopt a gradual & sequential approach with a focus on rehabilitation of
children working in hazardous occupations & processes in the first instance. The Action Plan outlined
in the Policy for tackling this problem is as follows:
o Legislative Action Plan for strict enforcement of Child Labour Act and other labour
laws to ensure that children are not employed in hazardous employments, and that
the working conditions of children working in non-hazardous areas are regulated in
accordance with the provisions of the Child Labour Act. It also entails further
identification of additional occupations and processes, which are detrimental to
the health and safety of the children.
o Focusing of General Developmental Programmes for Benefiting Child Labour -
As poverty is the root cause of child labour, the action plan emphasizes the need to
cover these children and their families also under various poverty alleviation and
employment generation schemes of the Government.
o Project Based Plan of Action envisages starting of projects in areas of high
concentration of child labour. Pursuant to this, in 1988, the National Child Labour
Project (NCLP) Scheme was launched in 9 districts of high child labour endemicity
in the country. The Scheme envisages running of special schools for child labour
withdrawn from work. In the special schools, these children are provided
formal/non-formal education along with vocational training, a stipend of Rs.100
120
per month, supplementary nutrition and regular health check ups so as to prepare
them to join regular mainstream schools. Under the Scheme, funds are given to the
District Collectors for running special schools for child labour. Most of these
schools are run by the NGOs in the district.
Commission for protection of rights
The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) was set up in March 2007 under the
Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, an Act of Parliament (December 2005). The
Commission's Mandate is to ensure that all Laws, Policies, Programmes, and Administrative
Mechanisms are in consonance with the Child Rights perspective as enshrined in the Constitution of
India and also the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Child is defined as a person in the 0
to 18 years age group.
The Commission visualises a rights-based perspective flowing into National Policies and
Programmes, along with nuanced responses at the State, District and Block levels, taking care of
specificities and strengths of each region. In order to touch every child, it seeks a deeper penetration
to communities and households and expects that the ground experiences inform the support the
field receives from all the authorities at the higher level. Thus the Commission sees an indispensable
role for the State, sound institution-building processes, respect for decentralization at the level of
the local bodies at the community level and larger societal concern for children and their well-being.

Ban on employment of children
Ban on employment of children as domestic servants or in dhabas (roadside eateries), restaurants,
hotels, motels, teashops, resorts, spas or in other recreational centers is now in force from 10th
October 2006 under the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986. The Union Ministry of
Labour had earlier issued a notification giving three-month mandatory notice. The Ministry has
warned that anyone employing children in these categories would be liable to prosecution and other
penal action under the Act.
Rehabilitating Children
The Labour Ministry has sought necessary support from the State Governments in enforcing the ban
on employment of children as domestic servants and also in eateries etc. In a letter to the Chief
Ministers, the Minister for Labour and Employment has also sought their support in rehabilitating
128
children withdrawn from work due to this ban. The Ministry is holding zonal level meetings to
sensitize the concerned state level officials, civil society organisations, NGOs and other stakeholders.
The Secretary, Labour and Employment, has also written to his counterparts in several Central
Government Ministries requesting them for infrastructure support by the concerned departments
towards rehabilitation of the released children from work and their families as an immediate
objective. He has also urged them to make specific provisions in the schemes of their Ministries for
working children and their families as a long term measure. The Secretaries who have been
approached include those from the Ministries of Women and Child Development, Human Resource
Development, Rural Development, Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation, Social Justice and
Empowerment. The views and cooperation of industrial associations and NGOs are also sought in
providing necessary support towards rehabilitation as a consequence of ban. Government servants
have already been prohibited from employing children as domestic servants.
Child Helpline
A toll free 24-hour telephone help line 1098 for children in distress can be accessed in 72 cities of
the country. This number can be available by any child or concerned adult on his or her behalf. This
helpline, easily remembered in Hindi as “Dus, Nau, Aath”, is presently working in the following 72

application must be made in triplicate, accompanied by treasury receipt showing the payment of
fees. The Registering Officer will register the Company and issue a Certificate of Registration. If the
Company fails to obtain Certificate of Registration, the position would be that the workmen
employed by the Contractors would be deemed to be employed by the Company, which is the
Principal Employer.

4p. MATERNITY BENEFIT ACT, 1961
Motherhood is a very special experience in a woman’s life. A woman needs to be able to give quality
time to her child without having to worry about whether she will lose her job and her source of
income. That is where the concept of maternity leave and the benefits it entails, comes in handy.
The Maternity Benefits Act, 1961, gives her the assurance that her rights will be looked after while
she is at home to care for her child.
The object of the Act is to regulate the employment of women in certain establishments for certain
periods before and after childbirth and to provide for maternity benefits and certain other benefits.
Applicability of the Act
This act applies to women who work in factories, mines, plantations, circus industry, shops and
establishment with more than 10 employees. It does not apply to employees covered by the
Employees State Insurance Act, 1948. It can be extended to other establishments by the State
Governments.
Important definitions under the Act

(ii) in relation to an establishment under any local authority, the person appointed by such authority
for the supervision and control of employees or where no person is so appointed, the chief executive

other articles. It does include any other kind of bonus, overtime earnings, any contribution towards

Persons entitled to maternity benefit
Every woman is entitled to the payment of maternity benefit at the rate of the average daily wage
for the period of her actual absence immediately preceding and including the day of her delivery and
for the six weeks immediately following that day.
The average daily wage is calculated on the basis of the amount payable to her for the days on which
she has worked during the period of three calendar months immediately preceding the date from
which she has absented herself on account of maternity, or one rupee a day, whichever is higher.
To be eligible for maternity benefit, a woman should have worked in an establishment for not less
than 160 days in the twelve months immediately prior to the date of her expected delivery.
The maximum period for which any woman can be entitled to maternity benefit is twelve weeks.
This includes six weeks up to and including the day of her delivery and six weeks immediately
134
following that day. If a woman dies during this period, the maternity benefit will be payable only for
the days up to and including the day of her death. However, if she delivers a child and dies during
the delivery or during the period of six weeks following the delivery, the employer will be liable for
the maternity benefits of the entire period of six weeks immediately following the day of her
delivery. If the child dies during this period, the liability will be only up to and including the day of
the death of the child.
In case the woman dies before receiving the benefit, the amount must be paid to her nominee or
legal representative.
In the event of a miscarriage, the woman must produce relevant proof that she has suffered a
miscarriage. This will entitle her to receive leave with wages at the rate of the maternity benefit, for
a period of six weeks immediately following the date of the miscarriage.
Women who are ill on account of pregnancy, delivery, premature birth of a child or a miscarriage are
also entitled to a period of absence or to leave with wages at the rate of maternity benefit for a
maximum period of one month. However, they must submit proof of their illness.
Notice of claim for maternity benefit
A pregnant woman is required to give her employer a notice in writing, stating that the maternity
benefit that she is entitled to should be given to her or any person nominated by her and that she
will not be working during the period in which she receives the benefit. This notice should start from
the date when she was absent from work, provided that date is not earlier than six weeks from the
date of her expected delivery. This notice can also be given soon after the delivery.
On receiving the notice, the employer is bound to permit the woman to absent herself from work
until the expiry of six weeks after the delivery. In case a woman fails to give notice, this does not
disentitle her from claiming maternity benefit. The employer is still liable to pay her the amount due
to her.
Dismissal during absence on account of pregnancy
When a woman absents herself from work on account of illness during pregnancy, she may not be
discharged or dismissed by her employer or issued notice for dismissal. It is equally unlawful for the
employer to alter any of the conditions of her service to her disadvantage.
If she is discharged or dismissed from service, she should still be entitled to receiving maternity
benefit or medical bonus. She cannot be deprived of these.
135
The woman can be dismissed only if she is guilty of gross misconduct. In this case, the employer is
well within his rights to deprive her of the maternity benefit or medical bonus.
A woman who has been deprived of maternity benefit or medical bonus may, within sixty days from
the date on which the order was communicated to her, appeal to the relevant authority. This
authority has the final say on whether the woman should or should not be deprived of these
benefits.
If a woman continues to report to work during the period when she is entitled to maternity benefit,
she forfeits her claim to the maternity benefit for the period. However, individual companies may
allow the woman to take her leave as late as possible so that she may have more time to nurse the
baby later on.
Punishment under the Act
An employer who violates the provisions of the Maternity Benefits Act can be punishable with
imprisonment up to three months or with fine up to five hundred rupees or both. Besides, if the
violation is related to the non-payment of maternity benefit or any other amount, the court can
recover this amount as if it is a fine and pay it to the aggrieved person.
5. CHECKLIST OF LABOUR LAW COMPLIANCE
Statutory compliance under various labour laws has to be ensured by establishments. It is not just
limited to the statutory deposits, returns and records to be maintained by the employer under
various labour laws, but also to represent them in case of prosecution under various statutes. Hence,
it hardly needs to be emphasized that the labour related laws cast an obligation on the employer for
meticulous, impeccable and timely compliances. In the event of violation or delay in complying with
the statutory requirements, the consequences in terms of levy of damages, prosecution is inevitable.

7. LABOUR LAWS IN THE UNORGANIZED SECTOR
The unorganized sector can be defined as that part of the work force that have not been able to
organize itself in pursuit of a common objective because of certain constraints such as casual nature
148
of employment, ignorance or illiteracy, superior strength of the employer singly or in combination
etc. viz. construction workers, labour employed in cottage industry, handloom/power loom workers,
sweepers and scavengers, beedi and cigar workers etc. This sector is marked by low incomes,
unstable and irregular employment, and lack of protection either from legislation or trade unions.
The unorganized sector uses mainly labour intensive and indigenous technology.
Out of 440 million workers in India, 93% of the workers are in the unorganized sector. The
contributions made by the unorganized sector to the national income, is very substantial as
compared to that of the organized sector. It adds more than 60% to the national income while the
contribution of the organised sector is almost half of that depending on the industry.
Under this category are laws like the Building and Construction Workers Act 1996, the Bonded
Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976, The Interstate Migrant Workers Act 1979, The Dock Workers Act
1986, The Plantation Labour Act 1951, The Transport Workers Act, The Beedi and Cigar Workers Act
1966, The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986, and The Mine Act 1952. Many of the
labour and employment laws apply to the unorganized sector also.
In India, only about 8% of workers actually get the benefits available under various labour Acts. The
rest 92% work in the unorganized sector, and either are not eligible for coverage, or these Acts are
just not implemented for them, with the result that these workers have insecure employments and
low incomes. They have no coverage of social security, and have to spend out of their meager
incomes for all contingencies such as illness and children’s education; in their old age they are
helpless.
This is so because the Acts as they exist today only apply to those workers who have a clear
employer-employee relationship. 50% of India’s workers are self employed like small and marginal
farmers, artisans and street vendors, many workers work for contractors or have no fixed employer
like agricultural labourers and home-based workers and also, employers have been decentralizing,
hiring contract labour and divesting themselves of responsibility, so that even organized workers are
becoming unorganized. Second, workers are not organized and hence have no bargaining power,
because of this, even when laws exist workers are too weak, too disorganized to demand them.
Third, no social security system has been devised which would meet the needs of these workers. For
example, many of these workers are migratory; others have no fixed income, and could pay at
certain times but not at others. Fourth, the laws are supposed to be implemented through the
149
Government bureaucracy which has neither the manpower nor the knowhow to reach the scattered
crores of workers.
Purpose of the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act of 2008
This Act builds a social security system for the unorganized workers. It does the following:
1. It redefines worker so as to include all types of workers, not only those who have a fixed
employer. In so doing, it brings in all the self employed workers as well as casual, contract,
home based etc.
2. It identifies each worker and gives him/her a unique social security number and social
security card.
3. It offers a variety of social security benefits to the unorganized worker. These would
include health insurance, maternity benefit and pensions. As these schemes become
successful, the trust and participation of workers’ builds up, and more funds come in, a
variety of different benefits can be included such as children’s education, housing, skill
building etc.
4. It binds the Central Government to providing a minimum amount of benefits and funds.
5. It creates a structure, an architecture that works with but does not rely solely on the
Government system. It creates a participatory structure that builds on already existing civil
society, government and semi-government organizations which have a good record.
6. It encourages the unorganized workers to organize around the social security structures
and benefits, creating a voice and space for them.

the Union Government. The authority will be responsible for managing the funds and implementing
the provisions of the Act. It will appoint the Facilitating Agencies as the implementing agencies on its
behalf.
8. WOMEN LABOUR AND THE LAW
Women are known to work on farms, in road and housing construction, and of late, in factories
manufacturing garments and electronic assembly plants. Skilled women workers also have been
working in traditional village industries either as self employed or as paid workers. In hill areas,
search for forest products including fuel wood engages a fairly large number of women. The majority
152
of women work in the unorganized sector for low wages and at low levels of skills. The number of
women workers during the last four decades has more than doubled from 40 million to 90 million.
Women constitute a significant part of the workforce in India but they lag behind men in terms of
work participation and quality of employment. According to Government sources, out of 407 million
total workforce, 90 million are women workers, largely employed (about 87 percent) in the
agricultural sector as labourers and cultivators.
Employment opportunities and wage disparity
In India, as in many developing countries, gender inequality persists in terms of women participation
in labour force, lower wages and salaries of women and access to resources. The percentage share
of female population in total population in India is around 48%, while the work participation rate of
females is only 26% as compared to 52% in males. About 24.9% of women in rural areas and about
14.8% of women in urban areas were in the workforce in India during 2004-05 (UNCTAD report).
In urban areas, on an average wage/salary paid to females is only 75% of that paid to males, while in
rural areas females are paid 58% of what is paid to the males. This wage disparity differs across
sectors and education levels.
Applicability of Labour laws for women
In addition to the Maternity Benefit Act, 1961 almost all the major central labour laws are applicable
to women workers. The Equal Remuneration Act was passed in 1976, providing for the payment of
equal remuneration to men and women workers for same or similar nature of work. Under this law,
no discrimination is permissible in recruitment and service conditions except where employment of
women is prohibited or restricted by the law. The situation regarding enforcement of the provisions
of this law is regularly monitored by the Central Ministry of Labour and the Central Advisory
Committee. In respect of occupational hazards concerning the safety of women at workplaces, in
1997 the Supreme Court of India in the case of Vishakha Vs. State of Rajasthan [(1997) 6 SCC 241]
held that sexual harassment of working women amounts to violation of rights of gender equality. As
a logical consequence it also amounts to violation of the right to practice any profession, occupation,
and trade. The judgment also laid down the definition of sexual harassment, the preventive steps,
the complaint mechanism, and the need for creating awareness of the rights of women workers.
Implementation of these guidelines has already begun by employers by amending the rules under
the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.
The Factories Act, 1948 has the following provisions of interest to women (Sections 19, 22(2), 27,
42(1)(b), 48, 66, 79(1) and 114.):
153
a. The Act prohibits women from being employed in cleaning; lubricating or adjusting certain
machinery when it is in motion, if that would expose them to risk of injury. Women are also
not allowed to work in the part of a factory where a cotton-opener is at work unless certain
conditions are met.
b. Suitable sanitation facilities must be provided.
c. If more than 30 women are employed, the employer must provide a free crèche on the
premises for children under six years of age. State governments may make rules governing
these crèches, which may include requirements to provide clothes washing and changing
facilities, child-feeding facilities and free milk and refreshments for the children.
d. Women cannot be exempted from the requirement that the maximum working day for
adults is 9 hours, and cannot work in factories between the hours of 6am and 7 pm (unless
the factory falls within a specific exemption, but in any case, not between the hours or 10
pm and 5 am.). In relation to women, there must not be a change of shifts except after a
weekly or other holiday. However, the State governments can change these requirements in
the fish curing and canning industries.
e. Periods of absence on maternity leave are included in calculating periods of service for the
purposes of annual leave.

9. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Concept of Industrial Relations
The term ‘Industrial Relations’ comprises of two terms: ‘Industry’ and ‘Relations’. “Industry” refers
to “any productive activity in which an individual (or a group of individuals) is (are) engaged”. By
“relations” we mean “the relationships that exist within the industry between the employer and his
workmen.” The term industrial relations explain the relationship between employees and
management which stem directly or indirectly from union-employer relationship. Industrial relations
are the relationships between employees and employers within the organizational settings. The field
of industrial relations looks at the relationship between management and workers, particularly
groups of workers represented by a union. Industrial relations are basically the interactions between
employers, employees and the government, and the institutions and associations through which
such interactions are mediated. The term industrial relations have a broad as well as a narrow
outlook. Originally, industrial relations were broadly defined to include the relationships and
interactions between employers and employees. From this perspective, industrial relations cover all
aspects of the employment relationship, including human resource management, employee
relations, and union-management (or labour) relations. Now its meaning has become more specific
and restricted. Accordingly, industrial relations pertains to the study and practice of collective
bargaining, trade unionism, and labour-management relations, while human resource management
is a separate, largely distinct field that deals with non-union employment relationships and the
personnel practices and policies of employers. The relationships which arise at and out of the
workplace generally include the relationships between individual workers, the relationships between
workers and their employer, the relationships between employers, the relationships employers and
workers have with the organizations formed to promote their respective interests, and the relations
between those organizations, at all levels. Industrial relations also includes the processes through
which these relationships are expressed (such as, collective bargaining, workers’ participation in
decision-making, and grievance and dispute settlement), and the management of conflict between
employers, workers and trade unions, when it arises. The relationship between Employer and
employee or trade unions is called Industrial Relation. Harmonious relationship is necessary for both
employers and employees to safeguard the interests of the both the parties of the production. In
order to maintain good relationship with the employees, the main functions of every organization
should avoid any dispute with them or settle it as early as possible so as to ensure industrial peace
and higher productivity. Personnel management is mainly concerned with the human relation in
industry because the main theme of personnel management is to get the work done by the human
158
power and it fails in its objectives if good industrial relation is maintained. In other words good
Industrial Relation means industrial peace which is necessary for better and higher productions.
Definition of Industrial Relations
1. Industrial Relation is that part of management which is concerned with the manpower of the
enterprise – whether machine operator, skilled worker or manager. BETHEL, SMITH &
GROUP
2. Industrial Relation is a relation between employer and employees, employees and
employees and employees and trade unions. - Industrial dispute Act 1947
3. While moving from jungle of the definitions, here, Industrial Relation is viewed as the
“process by which people and their organizations interact at the place of work to establish
the terms and conditions of employment.”
The Industrial Relation relations is also called as labour - management, employee-employers
relations.
Labour relations can take place on many levels, such as the "shop-floor", the regional level, and the
national level. The distribution of power amongst these levels can greatly shape the way an
economy functions.
Governments set the framework for labour relations through legislation and regulation.
Industrial relations has become one of the most delicate and complex problems of modern industrial
society. Industrial progress is impossible without cooperation of labours and harmonious
relationships. Therefore, it is in the interest of all to create and maintain good relations between
employees (labour) and employers (management).
A few notable features pertaining to Industrial Relations are as under:
1. Industrial Relation does not emerge in vacuum they are born of employment
relationship in an industrial setting. Without the existence of the two parties, i.e. labour
and management, this relationship cannot exist. It is the industry, which provides the
environment for industrial relations.
2. Industrial Relations are characterized by both conflict and co-operations. This is the
basis of adverse relationship. So the focus of Industrial Relations in on the study of the
159
attitudes, relationships, practices and procedure developed by the contending parties to
resolve or at least minimize conflicts.
3. As the labour and management do not operate in isolations but are parts of large
system, so the study of Industrial Relation also includes vital environment issues like
technology of the workplace, country’s socio-economic and political environment,
nation’s labour policy, attitude of trade unions workers and employers.
4. Industrial Relation also involve the study of conditions conductive to the labour,
management’s co-operations as well as the practices and procedures required to elicit
the desired co-operation from both the parties.
5. Industrial Relations also study the laws, rules regulations agreements, awards of courts,
customs and traditions, as well as policy framework lay down by the governments for
eliciting co-operations between labour and management. Besides this, it makes an indepth analysis of the interference patterns of the executive and judiciary in the
regulations of labour–managements relations.
In fact the concepts of Industrial Relations are very broad-based, drawing heavily from a variety of
discipline like social sciences, humanities, behavioural sciences, laws etc.
Industrial Relation encompasses all such factors that influence behaviour of people at work. A few
such important factors are details below:
1. Institution: It includes government, employers, trade unions, unions’ federations or
associations, government bodies, labour courts, tribunals and other organizations which
have direct or indirect impact on the industrial relations systems.
2. Characters : It aims to study the role of workers unions and employers’ federations
officials, shop stewards, industrial relations officers/ manager, mediator/conciliators /
arbitrator, judges of labour court, tribunal etc.
3. Methods : Focus on collective bargaining, workers’ participation in the Industrial Relation
schemes, discipline procedure, grievance re-dressal machinery, dispute settlements
machinery working of closed shops, union reorganization, organizations of protests through
methods like revisions of existing rules, regulations, policies, procedures, hearing of labour
courts, tribunals etc.
160
4. Contents : Includes matter pertaining to employment conditions like pay, hours of works,
leave with wages, health, and safety disciplinary actions, lay-off, dismissals retirements etc.,
laws relating to such activities, regulations governing labour welfare, social security,
industrial relations, issues concerning with workers’ participation in management, collective
bargaining, etc.
Objectives of Industrial Relation
1. To safeguard the interest of labour and management by securing the highest level of mutual
understanding and good-will among all those sections in the industry which participate in
the process of production.
2. To avoid industrial conflict or strife and develop harmonious relations, which are an
essential factor in the productivity of workers and the industrial progress of a country.
3. To raise productivity to a higher level in an era of full employment by lessening the tendency
to high turnover and frequency absenteeism.
4. To establish and nurse the growth of an Industrial Democracy based on labour partnership in
the sharing of profits and of managerial decisions, so that ban individuals personality may
grow its full stature for the benefit of the industry and of the country as well.
5. To eliminate, as far as is possible and practicable, strikes, lockouts and gheraos by providing
reasonable wages, improved living and working conditions, said fringe benefits.
6. To establish government control of such plants and units as are running at a loss or in which
productions has to be regulated in the public interest.
7. Improvements in the economic conditions of workers in the existing state of industrial
managements and political government.
8. Control exercised by the state over industrial undertaking with a view to regulating
production and promoting harmonious industrial relations.
9. Socializations or rationalization of industries by making the state itself a major employer
10. Vesting of a proprietary interest of the workers in the industries in which they are employed.
The main aspect of Industrial Relations are:-
1. Labour Relations, i.e. relations between union and management.
161
2. Employer-employees relations, i.e. relations between management and employees.
3. Group relations, i.e. relations between various groups of workmen.
4. Community or Public relations, i.e. relations between industry and society.
5. Promotions and development of healthy labour-managements relations.
6. Maintenance of industrial peace and avoidance of industrial strife
7. Development of true industrial Democracy.
Effects of poor Industrial Relations
Poor Industrial Relation produces highly disquieting effects on the economic life of the country. We
may enumerate the ill-effects of poor Industrial Relations as under:
1. Multiplier effects: Modern industry and for that matter modern economy are
interdependent. Hence although the direct loss caused due to industrial conflict in any
one plant may not be very great, the total loss caused due to its multipliers effect on the
total economy is always very great.
2. Fall in normal tempo: poor Industrial Relations adversely affect the normal tempo of
work so that work far below the optimum level. Costs build up. Absenteeism and labour
turnover increase. Plants discipline breaks down and both the quality and quality of
production suffer.
3. Resistance of change: Dynamic industrial situation calls for change more or less
continuously. Methods have to be improved. Economics have to be introduced. New
products have to be designed, produced and put in the market. Each of these tasks
involves a whole chain of changes and this is resisted bitterly if these are industrial
conflict.
4. Frustration and social cost: every man comes to the work place not only to earn a living.
He wants to satisfy his social and egoistic needs also. When he finds difficulty in
satisfying these needs he feels frustrated. Poor Industrial Relations take a heavy toll in
terms of human frustration. They reduce cordiality and aggravate social tension.
Suggestions to Improve Industrial Relation:-
162
1. Both management and unions should develop constructive attitudes towards each
other
2. All basic policies and procedures relating to Industrial Relation should be clear to
everybody in the organization and to the union leader. The personnel manager must
make certain that line people will understand and agree with these policies.
3. The personnel manager should remove any distrust by convincing the union of the
company’s integrity and his own sincerity and honesty. Suspicious, rumours and doubts
should all be put to rest.
4. The personnel manager should not vie with the union to gain workers‘ loyal to both the
organization. Several research studies also confirm the idea of dual allegiance. There is
strong evidence to discard the belief that one can owe allegiance to one group only.
5. Management should encourage right kind of union leadership. While it is not for the
management to interfere with union activities, or choose the union leadership, its
action and attitude will go a long way towards developing the right kind of union
leadership.
IMPORTANCE OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS:
The healthy industrial relations are a key to the progress. Their significance may be discussed as
under -
1. Uninterrupted production – The most important benefit of industrial relations is that
this ensures continuity of production. This means, continuous employment for all from
manager to workers. The resources are fully utilized, resulting in the maximum possible
production. There is uninterrupted flow of income for all. Smooth running of an
industry is of vital importance for several other industries; to other industries if the
products are intermediaries or inputs; to exporters if these are export goods; to
consumers and workers, if these are goods of mass consumption.
2. Reduction in Industrial Disputes – Good industrial relation reduces the industrial
disputes. Disputes are reflections of the failure of basic human urges or motivations to
secure adequate satisfaction or expression which are fully cured by good industrial
relations. Strikes, lockouts, go-slow tactics, gherao and grievances are some of the
reflections of industrial unrest which do not spring up in an atmosphere of industrial
peace. It helps promoting co-operation and increasing production.
163
3. High morale – Good industrial relations improve the morale of the employees.
Employees work with great zeal with the feeling in mind that the interest of employer
and employees is one and the same, i.e. to increase production. Every worker feels that
he is a co-owner of the gains of industry. The employer in his turn must realize that the
gains of industry are not for him along but they should be shared equally and
generously with his workers. In other words, complete unity of thought and action is
the main achievement of industrial peace. It increases the place of workers in the
society and their ego is satisfied. It naturally affects production because mighty cooperative efforts alone can produce great results.
4. Mental Revolution – The main object of industrial relation is a complete mental
revolution of workers and employees. The industrial peace lies ultimately in a
transformed outlook on the part of both. It is the business of leadership in the ranks of
workers, employees and Government to work out a new relationship in consonance
with a spirit of true democracy. Both should think themselves as partners of the
industry and the role of workers in such a partnership should be recognized. On the
other hand, workers must recognize employer’s authority. It will naturally have impact
on production because they recognize the interest of each other.
5. New Programmes – New programmes for workers development are introduced in an
atmosphere of peace such as training facilities, labour welfare facilities etc. It increases
the efficiency of workers resulting in higher and better production at lower costs.
6. Reduced Wastage – Good industrial relations are maintained on the basis of
cooperation and recognition of each other. It will help increase production. Wastages of
man, material and machines are reduced to the minimum and thus national interest is
protected.
Thus, from the above discussion, it is evident that good industrial relation is the basis of higher
production with minimum cost and higher profits. It also results in increased efficiency of workers.
New and new projects may be introduced for the welfare of the workers and to promote the morale
of the people at work.
An economy organized for planned production and distribution, aiming at the realization of social
justice and welfare of the massage can function effectively only in an atmosphere of industrial
164
peace. If the twin objectives of rapid national development and increased social justice are to be
achieved, there must be harmonious relationship between management and labour.
Difference between industrial relations and human relations
The term “Industrial Relations” is different from “Human Relations”. Industrial relations refer to the
relations between the employees and the employer in an industry. Human relations refer to a
personnel-management policy to be adopted in industrial organizations to develop a sense of
belongingness in the workers improves their efficiency and treat them as human beings and make a
partner in industry.
Industrial relations cover the matters regulated by law or by collective agreement between
employees and employers. On the other hand, problems of human relations are personal in
character and are related to the behavior of worker where morale and social elements
predominated. Human relations approach is personnel philosophy which can be applied by the
management of an undertaking. The problem of industrial relations is usually dealt with a three
levels – the level of undertaking, the industry and at the national level. To sum up the term
“Industrial Relations” is more wide and comprehensive and the term “Human Relations” is a part of
it.
Determining factors of industrial relations –
Good industrial relations depend on a great variety of factors. Some of the more obvious ones are
listed below:
1. History of industrial relations – No enterprise can escape its good and bad history of
industrial relations. A good history is marked by harmonious relationship between
management and workers. A bad history by contrast is characterized by militant strikes
and lockouts. Both types of history have a tendency to perpetuate themselves. Once
militancy is established as a mode of operations there is a tendency for militancy to
continue. Or once harmonious relationship is established there is a tendency for
harmony to continue.
2. Economic satisfaction of workers – Psychologists recognize that human needs have a
certain priority. Need number one is the basic survival need. Much of men conducted
are dominated by this need. Man works because he wants to survive. This is all the
more for underdeveloped countries where workers are still living under subsistence
165
conditions. Hence economic satisfaction of workers is another important prerequisite
for good industrial relations.
3. Social and Psychological satisfaction – Identifying the social and psychological urges of
workers is a very important step in the direction of building good industrial relations. A
man does not live by bread alone. He has several other needs besides his physical needs
which should also be given due attention by the employer. An organization is a joint
venture involving a climate of human and social relationships wherein each participant
feels that he is fulfilling his needs and contributing to the needs of others. This
supportive climate requires economic rewards as well as social and psychological
rewards such as workers’ participation in management, job enrichment, suggestion
schemes, re-dressal of grievances etc.
4. Off-the-Job Conditions – An employer employs a whole person rather than certain
separate characteristics. A person’s traits are all part of one system making up a whole
man. His home life is not separable from his work life and his emotional condition is not
separate from his physical condition. Hence for good industrial relations it is not enough
that the worker’s factory life alone should be taken care of his off-the-job conditions
should also be improved to make the industrial relations better.
5. Enlightened Trade Unions – The most important condition necessary for good industrial
relations is a strong and enlightened labour movement which may help to promote the
status of labour without harming the interests of management, Unions should talk of
employee contribution and responsibility. Unions should exhort workers to produce
more, persuade management to pay more, mobilize public opinion on vital labour
issues and help Government to enact progressive labour laws.
6. Negotiating skills and attitudes of management and workers – Both management and
workers’ representation in the area of industrial relations come from a great variety of
backgrounds in terms of training, education, experience and attitudes. These varying
backgrounds play a major role in shaping the character of industrial relations. Generally
speaking, well-trained and experienced negotiators who are motivated by a desire for
industrial peace create a bargaining atmosphere conducive to the writing of a just and
equitable collective agreement. On the other hand, ignorant, inexperienced and illtrained persons fail because they do not recognize that collective bargaining is a difficult
human activity which deals as much in the emotions of people as in their economic
166
interests. It requires careful preparation and top –notch executive competence. It is not
usually accomplished by some easy trick or gimmick. Parties must have trust and
confidence in each other. They must possess empathy, i.e. they should be able to
perceive a problem from the opposite angle with an open mind. They should put
themselves in the shoes of the other party and then diagnose the problem. Other
factors which help to create mutual trust are respect for the law and breadth of the
vision. Both parties should show full respect for legal and voluntary obligations and
should avoid the tendency to make a mountain of a mole hill.
7. Public policy and legislation: - when Government, regulates employee relations, it
becomes a third major force determining industrial relations the first two being the
employer and the union. Human behaviour is then further complicated as all three
forces interact in a single employee relation situation. Nonetheless, government in all
countries intervenes in management – union relationship by enforcing labour laws and
by insisting that the goals of whole society shall take precedence over those of either of
the parties. Government intervention helps in three different ways 1) it helps in
catching and solving problems before they become serious. Almost everyone agrees
that it is better to prevent fires them to try stopping them after they start; 2) It provides
a formalized means to the workers and employers to give emotional release to their
dissatisfaction; and 3) It acts as a check and balance upon arbitrary and capricious
management action.
8. Better education: - with rising skills and education workers’ expectations in respect of
rewards increase. It is a common knowledge that the industrial worker in India is
generally illiterate and is misled by outside trade union leaders who have their own axe
to grind. Better workers’ education can be a solution to this problem. This alone can
provide worker with a proper sense of responsibility, which they owe to the
organization in particular, and to the community in general.
9. Nature of industry: - In those industries where the costs constitute a major proportion
of the total cast, lowering down the labour costs become important when the product is
not a necessity and therefore, there is a little possibility to pass additional costs on to
consumer. Such periods, level of employment and wages rise in decline in employment
and wages. This makes workers unhappy and destroys good industrial relations.
Industrial Relations Programme
167
Today’s professional industrial relations director, or by whatever title he is designated, no longer
views his job as personalizing management, or that of a social worker in a factory, or a union buster,
he looks upon his department as an adjunct to management supervision at all levels; he keeps other
executives informed about new discoveries, programme trends and needs. At the same time, he
provides efficient service in the operation of several centralized services.
A successful industrial relations programme reflects the personnel viewpoint, which is influenced by
three main considerations:
a) Individual thinking
b) Policy awareness and
c) Expected group reaction
Individualized thinking makes if imperative for the administrator to consider the entire situation in
which the affected individual is placed. Policy awareness underscores the idea of the consistency of
treatment and the precedent value of any decision which a management takes; while expected
group reaction balances what we know of human nature in groups against an individual’s situation in
the light of the policy that has been formulated and implemented. In all these different
circumstances, reality demands that all the three aspects of the personnel viewpoint should be
considered at once in terms of the past, the present and the future. This viewpoint is held at all the
levels of management from the top to the bottom, from the top executives and staff to the line and
supervisory personnel.
Scope of industrial relations work
The staff employed in the industrial relations department should know the limitations within which
it has to function. The industrial relations director generally has several assistants who help him to
perform his functions effectively, and he usually reports directly to the president or chairman of the
board of directors of an organization.
The functions of the industrial relations staff are -
1. Administration, including overall organization, supervision and co-ordination of
industrial relations policies and programmes.
2. Liaison with outside groups and personnel departments as well as with various cadres
of the management staff.
168
3. Drafting of regulations, rules, laws or orders and their construction and interpretation.
4. Position classification, including overall direction of job analysis, salary and wage
administration, wage survey and pay schedules.
5. Recruitment and employment of workers and other staff.
6. Employment testing, including intelligence tests, mechanical aptitude tests and
achievement tests.
7. Placement, including induction and assignment.
8. Training of apprentices, production workers, foremen and executives.
9. Employee counselling on all types of personnel problems-educational, vocational,
health or behaviour problems.
10. Medical and health services.
11. Safety services, including first aid training.
12. Group activities, including group health insurance, housing, cafeteria programmes and
social clubs.
13. Suggestion plans and their uses in labour, management and production committees.
14. Employee relations, especially collective bargaining with representatives and settling
grievances.
15. Public relations.
16. Research in occupational trends and employee attitudes and analysis of labour
turnover.
17. Employee records for all purposes.
18. Control of operation surveys, fiscal research and analysis.
19. Benefit, retirement and pension programmes.
Functional Requirements of A Successful Industrial Relations Programme
The basic requirements on which a successful industrial relations programme is based are:-
169
1. Top Management Support: - Since industrial relations is a functional staff service, it must
necessarily derive its authority from the line organization. This is ensured by providing that
the industrial relations director should report to a top line authority to the president,
chairman or vice president of an organization.
2. Sound Personnel Policies: - These constitute the business philosophy of an organization and
guide it in arriving at its human relations decisions. The purpose of such policies is to decide,
before any emergency arises, what shall be done about the large number of problems which
crop up every day during the working of an organization. Policies can be successful only
when they are followed at all the level of an enterprise, from top to bottom.
3. Adequate Practices should be developed by professionals: - In the field to assist in the
implementation of the policies of an organization. A system of procedures is essential if
intention is to be properly translated into action. The procedures and practices of an
industrial relations department are the “tool of management” which enables a supervisor to
keep ahead of his job that of the time-keeper, rate adjuster, grievance reporter and merit
rater.
4. Detailed Supervisory Training :- To ensure the organizational policies and practices are
properly implemented and carried into effect by the industrial relations staff, job supervisors
should be trained thoroughly, so that they may convey to the employees the significance of
those policies and practices. They should, moreover, be trained in leadership and in
communications.
5. Follow-up of Results: - A constant review of an industrial relations programme is essential,
so that existing practices may be properly evaluated and a check may be exercised on
certain undesirable tendencies, should they manifest themselves. A follow up of turnover,
absenteeism, departmental morale, employee grievances and suggestion; wage
administration, etc. should be supplemented by continuous research to ensure that the
policies that have been pursued are best fitted to company needs and employee
satisfaction. Hints of problem areas may be found in exit interviews, in trade union demands
and in management meetings, as well as in formal social sciences research.
Perspective theories
When studying the theories of industrial relations, there are three major perspectives that contrast
in their approach to the nature of workplace relations. The three views are generally described as
the unitary, pluralist and Marxist perspectives. The Marxist perspective is sometimes referred to as
the Conflict Model. Each offers a particular perception of workplace relations and will therefore
170
interpret such events as workplace conflict, the role of trade unions and job regulation varies
differently.
1. Unitary perspective
In Unitarianism, the organization is perceived as an integrated and harmonious whole with the ideal
of "one happy family", where management and other members of the staff all share a common
purpose, emphasizing mutual cooperation. Furthermore, unitarism has a paternalistic approach
where it demands loyalty of all employees, being predominantly managerial in its emphasis and
application.
Consequently, trade unions are deemed as unnecessary since the loyalty between employees and
organizations are considered mutually exclusive, where there can't be two sides of industry. Conflict
is perceived as disruptive and the pathological result of agitators, interpersonal friction and
communication breakdown.
2. Pluralistic perspective
In pluralism the organization is perceived as being made up of powerful and divergent sub-groups,
each with its own legitimate loyalties and with their own set of objectives and leaders. In particular,
the two predominant sub-groups in the pluralistic perspective are the management and trade
unions.
Consequently, the role of management would lean less towards enforcing and controlling and more
toward persuasion and co-ordination. Trade unions are deemed as legitimate representatives of
employees; conflict is dealt by collective bargaining and is viewed not necessarily as a bad thing and,
if managed, could in fact be channelled towards evolution and positive change.
3. Marxist/Radical Perspective
This view of industrial relations looks at the nature of the capitalist society, where there is a
fundamental division of interest between capital and labour, and sees workplace relations against
this history. This perspective sees inequalities of power and economic wealth as having their roots in
the nature of the capitalist economic system. Conflict is therefore seen as inevitable and trade
unions are a natural response of workers to their exploitation by capital. Whilst there may be
periods of acquiescence, the Marxist view would be that institutions of joint regulation would
enhance rather than limit management's position as they presume the continuation of capitalism
rather than challenge it. There are two variants of this view - the pessimist view propounded by
Lenin, Trotsky and Michel and the optimist view propounded by Marx and Engels.
171
Industrial Relations in India
Prior to 1991, the industrial relations system in India sought to control conflicts and disputes through
excessive labour legislations. These labour laws were protective in nature and covered a wide range
of aspects of workplace industrial relations like laws on health and safety of labours, layoffs and
retrenchment policies, industrial disputes and the like. The basic purpose of these laws was to
protect labours. However, these protectionist policies created an atmosphere that led to increased
inefficiency in firms, over employment and inability to introduce efficacy. With the coming of
globalization, the 40 year old policy of protectionism proved inadequate for Indian industry to
remain competitive as the lack of flexibility posed a serious threat to manufacturers because they
had to compete in the international market.
With the advent of liberalization in 1992, the industrial relations policy began to change. Now, the
policy was tilted towards employers. Employers opted for workforce reduction, introduced policies
of voluntary retirement schemes and flexibility in workplace also increased. Thus, globalization
brought major changes in industrial relations policy in India. The changes can be summarized as
follows:
1. Collective bargaining in India has mostly been decentralized, but now in sectors where it was
not so, are also facing pressures to follow decentralization.
2. Some industries are cutting employment to a significant extent to cope with the domestic
and foreign competition e.g. pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, in other industries where
the demand for employment is increasing are experiencing employment growths.
3. In the expansionary economy there is a clear shortage of managers and skilled labour.
4. The number of local and enterprise level unions has increased and there is a significant
reduction in the influence of the unions.
5. Under pressure some unions and federations are putting up a united front e.g. banking.
6. Another trend is that the employers have started to push for internal unions i.e. no outside
affiliation.
7. HR policies and forms of work are emerging that include, especially in multi-national
companies, multi-skills, variable compensation, job rotation etc. These new policies are
difficult to implement in place of old practices as the institutional set up still needs to be
changed.
8. HRM is seen as a key component of business strategy.
9. Training and skill development is also receiving attention in a number of industries,
especially banking and information technology.
172
10. SPECIAL POINTS TO BE NOTED WHILE DRAFTING EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
Employment Agreement
Employment agreement is an agreement that is entered into between two parties, i.e. the employer
and employee. It is a document that pacifies the responsibilities and duties expected of an
employee. It also described the profile of the job and the title. The document ensures that the
employee knows his place in the organisation and what is expected of him. Employment agreements
should be created in a way that is just and fair for all the employees. If this is followed, employees
will do their tasks and responsibilities well and without any negative emotions toward their
employers. Usually employment contracts contain only vague references to the "policies and
procedures to which the employee will be bound". The employer should provide the employee with
all of the company policies and other documents that relate to the contract or are referred to in the
contract.
Following are the usual contents of an employment agreement:
1) Name of the parties involved
2) Starting date of employment
3) Title and description of the job
4) Location of work
5) Hours of work
6) Probationary period
7) Salary
8) Restrictive terms
9) Holidays
10) Other information like deductions, permissible expenses, notice period etc.
The employment agreement may be beneficial for both parties because they will know what
responsibilities they are getting in to. On the part of the employees, they are assured that they will
be able to get compensation as an exchange for the work they rendered. Employees will also be
clearly informed about the things that employers are expecting them to do. On the part of the
employers, they are assured that their employees are well informed of the things that they should
do, as well as their obligations for the company. Through employment agreement, employers will
not be left immediately by their employees without providing them enough time to seek for
someone who will take the latter’s place.
173
The benefits of an employment agreement are enumerated below:
 Employment agreement is useful because it has control over the employee’s capability to
leave. An employer will be given more time to find a replacement for the employee.
 If the employee is given confidential information about the business, certain confidentiality
clauses can also be included in the agreement. The employer may forbid the employee from
using or disclosing the information he/she acquired for personal gain.
 Employers can also use the employment agreement in enticing skilled individuals to work for
them. Certain promises like benefits that will be received as well as job security could be
included in the contract to convince the person into working for the company.
 Employee agreements also give employers control over their employees.
Certain important issues that need to be taken care of before finalizing the employment agreement
are given hereunder:
 Identify the long term requirement of employees.
 Identifying the workmen and employees not covered under definition of workmen,
respectively.
 Local laws of the State should be borne in mind while drawing up the contracts
 Issue appointment letters which clearly define the employment terms and conditions.
 Employment contracts, where necessary, should be put in place with clauses for wages,
benefits, non-compete, confidentiality, term, termination etc.
 Depending on the requirement, use fixed term contracts for workmen.
 The terms and conditions of the employment should be clearly explained to employees
before execution and should be drafted without any ambiguity.

Non-Disclosure Agreement / Contract of Confidentiality
A non-disclosure agreement is a legal agreement between two parties where the company gives
access to certain restricted information to the employee preventing its disclosure by the employee
to third parties. The secrecy of the restricted information is protected through the non-disclosure
agreement or the confidentiality agreement. If the classified information is transferred to the
employee orally he must provide in writing that the information so communicated constitutes
confidential information to which he is legally bound.
Confidential information constitutes the essence of every business. Disclosure of such information
may be potentially damaging to a company and provide an unfair advantage to its competitors.
Protection of confidential information, therefore, assumes tremendous importance. In the business
world, confidential information includes information that qualifies as a trade or business secret. A
176
trade secret is defined as any information that is not known outside the company and which is not
readily ascertainable by proper means, thereby giving the company an advantage over its
competitors. Whether any information is a trade secret depends on a variety of factors, such as the
extent to which the information is known outside of the company’s business; the extent to which
the information is known by employees and others involved in the company’s business; the
measures taken by the company to guard the secrecy of the information; the value of the
information to the company and to its competitors; the money or effort expended in developing the
information; and the ease with which the information can be duplicated by others. Examples of
trade secrets include methods of production not protected by patent, testing procedures, processes,
designs, formulas and software.
If it is found that the employee is likely to misuse confidential information obtained while in
employment, the employer is entitled to an injunction preventing such misuse. However, an
injunction cannot be granted to protect the employer for misuse that has already taken place. For
such past misuse, the employer is entitled only to damages; as otherwise, this will go against fair
competition. The injunction should not give a competitive advantage to the employer, as for
example no injunction should be granted if an employee obtains the information independently
from the market. Additional remedies include an award of damages for loss of profit because of
diminution in the employer’s business or damage to the employer’s goodwill. However, these are
not granted in the absence of detailed evidence to that effect.
The following steps can be taken by employers to protect confidential information:
i. Companies should ensure that before disclosing confidential information to employees, a
non-disclosure agreement is in place.
ii. Companies should ensure that the confidential nature of the information is expressly
communicated to the employees before disclosure.
iii. Companies should restrict the number of employees having access to confidential
information at any point of time.
iv. Companies should mark files and relevant documents as confidential.
v. Companies should have in place proper security systems for computers and networks.
Passwords should be provided and changed frequently.
vi. Companies should have in place proper policies for document retention and destruction.
vii. Companies should very clearly set forth the standards of non-disclosure of confidential
information in the employee handbook.
177
viii. Companies should take special care when an employee is leaving the company. The
employee should be reminded of his obligations and asked to deposit all confidential
material in his possession.
ix. A covenant of non-disclosure should also include a clause whereby the employee is under an
obligation to disclose to the employer any confidential information acquired in the course of
employment, which is in the nature of a trade secret for the company but unknown to the
employer.
11. IMPORTANT CASE LAWS
1. Apprentices Act, 1961
a) UP State Road Transport Corpn v. UP Parivahan Nigam Shishukh Berozgar Sangh AIR
1995 SC 1114 = (1995) 2 SCC 1 , it was held that other things being equal, a trained
apprentice should be given preference over direct recruits. It was also held that he need
not be sponsored by the employment exchange. Age bar may also be relaxed, to the
extent of training period. The concerned institute should maintain a list of persons
already trained and in between trained apprentices, preference should be given to those
who are senior. – same view in UP Rajya Vidyut Parishad v. State of UP 2000 LLR 869
(SC).
2. Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970
a) In Steel Authority of India v. National Union Water Front 2001(5) SCALE 626 = 2001
LLR 961 = AIR 2001 SC 3527 = JT 2001(5) SC 602 = 2001 III CLR 349 = (2001) 7 SCC 1 =
2001 LLN 135 = 2001 AIR SCW 3574 (SC 5 member Constitution bench), it was held
that Central / State Government can issue notification u/s 10 abolishing contract
labour only after following prescribed procedure regarding consultation etc. It was
also held that even if such a notification is issued, the employees with contractor will
not be automatically absorbed in the employment of the company, if the contact
was genuine. However, company will give preference to them. However, if the
contract was not genuine but a mere camouflage, the so called contract labour will
have to be treated as employees of principal employer.
b) Food Corporation of India Workers Union Vs Food Corporation of India and others,
1992 LLJ (Guj) - It has been held that workmen can be employed as contract labour
178
only through licensed contractors, who shall obtain licence under section 12. As per
section 7, the principal employer is required to obtain Certificate of Registration.
Unless both these conditions are complied with the provisions of Contract Labour
Act will not be attracted. Even if one of these conditions is not complied with, the
provisions of the Contract Labour Act will not apply. In a situation where in either of
these two conditions is not satisfied, the position would be that a workman
employed by an intermediary is deemed to have been employed by the principal
employer.
3. Employees Provident Funds Act, 1952
a) In RPFC v. T S Hariharan 1971 Lab IC 951 (SC), it was held that temporary workers
should not be counted to decide whether the Act would apply.
b) RPFC v. Shiv Kumar Joshi (1996) 4 CTJ 805 = 1996 LLR 641 (NCDRC 5 member
bench), it was held that the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner is providing
service under the Act and hence he is liable under Consumer Protection Act.
Confirmed in RPFC v. Shiv Kumar Joshi 1999 AIR SCW 4456 = 1999(7) SCALE 453 =
2000 LLR 217 = AIR 2000 SC 331 = 99 Comp Cas 347 = (2000) CLA-BL Supp 26 = 24
SCL 46 (SC).
4. Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972
a) “Gratuity” as observed by the Supreme Court in its etymological sense, means a gift,
especially for services rendered or return for favours received. AIR 1970 SC 919,
Delhi Cloth & General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Its Workmen.
b) AIR 1960 SC 251, Indian Hume Pipe Co. Ltd. v. ts Workmen. Gratuity has to be
considered to be an amount paid unconnected with any consideration and not
resting upon it and has to be considered something given freely or without
recompense. It does not have foundation on any legal liability, but upon a bounty
steaming from appreciation and graciousness. Long service carries with it
expectation of an appreciation from the employer and a gracious financial assistance
to tide over post retrial difficulties.
c) In the case of B. Mohan Reddy vs. A.P.S. Co-op.Marketing Federation Ltd. 1990 (1)
LLN 820 it was held that payment of Gratuity Act does not authorize employer to
with-hold Gratuity of employee for any reasons such as negligence and unauthorized
leave except where services of employee are terminated for any act of willful
179
omission or negligence which caused any damage, loss or destruction to employers
property or for riotous or disorderly behaviour or for any act which constitutes an
offence involving moral turpitude committed in the course of employment.
d) It has been held by the Bombay High Court in the case of Bombay Gas Public Ltd.
Co. V/s. Papa Akbar and Anr. 1990 II LLJ 220 that the provisions of Sec. 4 (6) (a) of
the payment of Gratuity Act do not come into force unless there is a termination of
service. Merely stating that the employee went on strike and thereby caused a
heavy loss to the company could not be a ground to deny gratuity to the employees.
e) Re-employment under same employer under fresh contract will not militate against
concept of gratuity - When an employee retires and earns gratuity and the same
employer offers such employee a job under a fresh agreement and the new
agreement provides for the payment of gratuity, that would, in no way, militate
against the concept of gratuity if such gratuity is paid on the first retirement - CIT v.

12. IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS
1. International Labour Organization
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations
that deals with labour issues. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland. Its secretariat —
the people who are employed by it throughout the world is known as the International
Labour Office.
The ILO was established as an agency of the League of Nations following the Treaty of
Versailles, which ended World War I. Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour
unions occupied the attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I.
The first annual conference (referred to as the International Labour Conference, or ILC)
began on 29 October 1919 in Washington DC and adopted the first six International Labour
Conventions, which dealt with hours of work in industry, unemployment, maternity
180
protection, night work for women, minimum age and night work for young persons in
industry. The prominent French socialist Albert Thomas became its first Director General.
The ILO became a member of the United Nations system after the demise of the League in
1946. Its constitution, as amended, includes the Declaration of Philadelphia (1944) on the
aims and purposes of the organisation. As of April 2009, the current director-general is Juan
Somavia (since 1999).
Unlike other United Nations specialized agencies, the International Labour Organization has
a tripartite governing structure — representing governments, employers and workers.
Presently there are 181 members.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) is devoted to advancing opportunities for
women and men to obtain decent and productive work in conditions of freedom, equity,
security and human dignity. Its main aims are to promote rights at work, encourage decent
employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue in handling
work-related issues. In promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and
labour rights, the organization continues to pursue its founding mission that labour peace is
essential to prosperity. Today, the ILO helps advance the creation of decent jobs and the
kinds of economic and working conditions that give working people and business people a
stake in lasting peace, prosperity and progress.
The Governing Body is the executive of the International Labour Office. It meets three times
a year, in March, June and November. It takes decisions on ILO policy, decides the agenda of
the International Labour Conference, adopts the draft programme and budget of the
organisation for submission to the conference, and elects the director-general. The
Governing Body is composed of 28 government representatives, 14 workers' group
representatives, and 14 employers' group representatives. Ten of the government seats are
held permanently by Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The remaining government
representatives are elected by government delegates every three years.

3. Labour Courts / Industrial Tribunals
Most of the labour disputes are referred to the Labour Courts/Industrial Tribunals through
the Department of Labour under the respective State Government. The process for labour
dispute starts with filing of a petition before Labour Conciliation Officer and in case no
compromise is possible, the said officer sends a failure report to the Government. After
consideration of the said report, the Government may send a reference to the Labour
Court/Industrial Tribunal. In certain matters, the labour dispute can be directly filed in the
court concerned.
Labour Courts These courts are found in every district and they form the courts of original
jurisdiction under which various labour laws and rules are enforced.
Appellate Labour Courts These courts hear only the Appeals and revisions originating from
the judgements and orders of the subordinate original labour courts and officers, under the
provisions of various labour and related laws.
a) When an industrial dispute has been referred to a Labour Court for adjudication, it is the
duty of the Labour Court to
(i) Hold proceedings expeditiously, and
(ii) To submit its award to the appropriate Government soon after the
conclusion of the proceedings.
b) However, no deadline has been laid down with respect to the time within which the
completion of proceedings has to be done. Nonetheless, it is expected that these Courts
hold their proceedings without getting into the technicalities of a Civil Court.
185
c) It has been held that the provisions of Article 137 of the Limitation Act do not apply to
reference of disputes to the Labour Courts. These Courts can change the relief granted
by refusing payment of back wages or directing payment of past wages too.
Court Fee
No Court fee is payable on the petitions filed before Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals.
Matters that fall within the jurisdiction of Industrial Tribunals
1. Wages, including the period and mode of payment
2. Compensatory and other allowances
3. Hours of work and rest intervals
4. Leave with wages and holidays
5. Bonus, profit sharing, provident fund and gratuity
6. Shift working otherwise than in accordance with standing orders
7. Classification by grades
8. Rules of discipline
9. Retrenchment of workmen and closure of establishment
Matters that fall within the jurisdiction of Labour Courts
1. The propriety or legality of an order passed by an employer under the standing orders
2. The application and interpretation of standing order
3. Discharge or dismissal of workmen including re-instatement of, or grant of relief to,
workmen wrongfully dismissed.
4. Withdrawal of any customary concession or privilege
5. Illegality or otherwise of a strike or lock-out; and
6. All matters other than those being referred to Industrial Tribunals.
Stages of adjudication in labour or industrial disputes
186
The first is receiving a reference from the appropriate Government or filing of the labour
dispute in the Labour Court. The next step is sending notice to the Management and after
filing of the response by them, the matter is fixed for adjudication. The fourth step is
recording the evidence of the parties and hearing the arguments.
The final conclusion of the dispute
After hearing the parties, the Labour Court/Industrial Tribunal decides the dispute and the
said final decision is called an Award. A copy of the award is to be published by the Labour
Department as per rules. Copies of the same are also sent to the parties concerned.
Execution of Awards
In case the management does not comply with the terms of the award, the workman may
pray for its execution by moving an application before the concerned Conciliation Officer.
14. LABOUR LEGISLATIONS ACROSS THE WORLD
1. Australia
Australian labour law has had a unique development that distinguishes it from other English
speaking jurisdictions.
In 1904 the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed mandating "Conciliation and Arbitration
for the Prevention and Settlement of Industrial Disputes extending beyond the Limits of any one
State". In 2005, the WorkChoices Act removed unfair dismissal laws, removed the "no
disadvantage test", and made it possible for workers to submit their certified agreements
directly to Workplace Authority rather than going through the Australian Industrial Relations
Commission. There were also clauses in WorkChoices that made it harder for workers to strike,
made it easier for employers to force their employees onto individual workplace agreements
rather than collective agreements, and banning clauses from workplace agreements which
supported trade unions.
The Workplace Relations Act 1996, as amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment Act
2005, or WorkChoices, which came into effect in March 2006, was a comprehensive change to
industrial relations in Australia.
2. United Kingdom
187
United Kingdom labour law is that body of law which regulates the rights, and obligations of
trade unions, workers and employers in the United Kingdom. Labour law, often also referred to
as "employment law" has developed rapidly over the past forty years, due to a historically strong
trades union movement and the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union (since
1973). In its current form, it is largely a creature of statute rather than Common Law. Leading
employment law statutes include the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Employment Act 2002
and various legislative provisions outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, disability,
sexual orientation, and religion and from 2006, age.
The operation of the Employment Law system is broadly similar across the whole of the UK,
although there are some differences in the common law between England & Wales and Scotland
and, in addition, Northern Ireland has extra anti-discrimination legislation dealing with
discrimination on the grounds of religion, community affiliation or political affiliation, which is
quite distinct from the laws on religious discrimination in Great Britain. The labour related laws
of UK are
 Employment Rights Act, 1996
 Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974
 National Minimum Wage Act, 1998
 Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002
 Equality Act, 2006
 Sex Discrimination Act 1975
 Equal Pay Act 1970
 Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations, 2003
 Disability Discrimination Act, 1995
 Trade Union Act 1871
 Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992
 Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006
188
3. China
Labour Law in the People's Republic of China has become a very hot issue with the soaring
numbers of factories and the fast pace of urbanization. The basic labour laws are the Labour Law
of People's Republic of China (promulgated on 5 July 1994) and the Law of the People's Republic
of China on Employment Contracts (Adopted at the 28th Session of the Standing Committee of
the 10th National People's Congress on June 29, 2007, Effective from January 1, 2008). The
administrative regulations enacted by the State Council, the ministerial rules and the judicial
explanations of the Supreme People’s Court stipulate detailed rules concerning the various
aspects of the employment relationship. Labour Union in China is controlled by the government
through the All China Federation of Trade Unions, which is also the sole legal labour union in
Mainland China. Strike is formally legal, but in fact is strictly forbidden.
According to the new 98-article-long "Labor Contract Law", employees of at least 10 years
standing are entitled to contracts that protect them from being dismissed without cause. The
new law also requires employers to contribute to employees' social security accounts and sets
wage standards for employees on probation and working overtime.
China's new labor contract law targets, primarily domestic companies that do not have labor
contracts and that generally fail to comply with China's old laws. Foreign companies have had a
stronger track record of signing contracts with employees and bringing to China their global
work rules and environmental, health and safety practices.
4. France
In France the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau's laws passed in 1884. Between 1936
and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid
vacation for workers, and a law limiting the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The
Grenelle accords negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis,
reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.
The minimum wage was also increased by 25%. In 2000 Lionel Jospin's government then
enacted the 35-hour workweek, down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime
minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contract (CNE). Addressing
the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked
criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it was lending favour to contingent
work. In 2006 he then attempted to pass the First Employment Contract (CPE) through a
189
vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by students and unions' protests.
President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it.
5. United States of America
United States labour law is a heterogeneous collection of state and federal laws. Federal law
not only sets the standards that govern workers' rights to organize in the private sector, but
overrides most state and local laws that attempt to regulate this area. Federal law also
provides more limited rights for employees of the federal government. These federal laws
do not, on the other hand, apply to employees of state and local governments, agricultural
workers or domestic employees; any statutory protections those workers have derived from
state law.
Both federal and state laws protect workers from employment discrimination. In most areas
these two bodies of law overlap; as an example, federal law permits state to enact their own
statutes barring discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin and age,
so long as the state law does not provide less protections than federal law would. Federal
law, on the other hand, preempts most state statutes that would bar employers from
discriminating against employees to prevent them from obtaining pensions or other benefits
or retaliating against them for asserting those rights.
Federal law does not provide employees of state and local governments with the right to
organize or engage in union activities, except to the extent that the United States
Constitution protects their rights to freedom of speech and freedom of association. The
Constitution provides even less protection for governmental employees' right to engage in
collective bargaining: while it bars public employers from retaliating against employees for
forming a union, it does not require those employers to recognize that union, much less
bargain with it.
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) establishes minimum wage and overtime rights
for most private sector workers, with a number of exemptions and exceptions. Congress
amended the Act in 1974 to cover governmental employees.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act establishes standards for the funding and
operation of pension and health care plans provided by employers to their employees.
190
The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, requires employers to provide workers
with twelve weeks of unpaid medical leave and continuing medical benefit coverage in order
to attend to certain medical conditions of close relatives or themselves.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act, signed into law in 1970 by President Richard Nixon,
creates specific standards for workplace safety. The Act also provides for protection for
"whistleblowers" who complain to governmental authorities about unsafe conditions while
allowing workers the right to refuse to work under unsafe conditions in certain
circumstances. The Act allows states to take over the administration of OSHA in their
jurisdictions, so long as they adopt state laws at least as protective of workers' rights as
under federal law.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 provides narrow prohibitions against
certain types of employment discrimination based on immigration status.
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, better known by its acronym as the
WARN Act, requires private sector employers to give sixty days' notice of large-scale layoffs
and plant closures; it allows a number of exceptions for unforeseen emergencies and other
cases.
